strangers with the help of a man named gary the narrator s neighbor meanwhile houses every newcomer who washes up on his porchhe welcomes so many people in fact that his house begins to deteriorate no matter how bad things get for the neighbor and the refugees living in his house isolationist ways eventually gary abandons the narrator to help the neighbor and the narrator reacts by suspecting gary and the neighbor of conspiring against him we leave the narrator lingering near their front door a knife in each hand waiting to defend his home from a siege that may never come this story is a piece of climate change fiction or clifi sure but it s also a parable a morality tale about the decisions one must make apocalypse do you empathize with the survivalist narrator or his selfless neighbor how would you act if your neighborhood flooded tomorrow diane cook centers her stories around moral conundrums like this one as man v nature s title suggests cook forces readers to question the limits of their humanity in the face of extreme circumstancessupernatural environmental futuristic or a combination of the three cook s debut novel the new wilderness towers above the stories in her collection it takes people are struggling to survive in urban society referred to simply as the city a group of the most vulnerable citizens retreat to an area known as the wilderness to live in a nomadic huntergatherer place called the community our protagonist bea decides to join the community because her daughter agnes is sick if she and agnes don t leave the city for the wilderness agnes s death is all but assured the emotional core of the the relationship between bea and agnes the most intricate and morally arresting relationship cook has conjured to date bea has joined the community to save her daughter s life and yet bea has entered into an existence full of cultish polyamory grisly hunting expeditions the consumption of raw meat insects and rodents not to mention maiming and death when bea can t bear life in the community any longer and abandons agnes to return to the city cook switches from bea and in doing so forces us to challenge our conception of bea from the viewpoint of the daughter she abandoned agnes dismisses her mean mother who had run away the meanest of them all perhaps she d never been anything but a mean mother and every kiss had been cruel meant to eventually because pain with its absence in presenting both sides of the situation cook asks how can we morally balance the initial sacrifice with the later abandonment how much are action considering the brutality of life in the wilderness to which bea was exposed things only get more complicated after bea returns to the community and attempts to get back into her daughter s good graces agnes hated that her mind would not let her curl back into her mother would not let her run to her without a care or worry or resentment would not let her forget that cloud of dust her mother had disappeared into she fell asleep to the exhalation of and to the urgency of her own thrumming heart the relationship between mother and daughter continues to oscillate between caring and rejection love and hate as agnes matures and becomes a woman in her own right falls in love and begins to contemplate becoming a mother herself a process that throws her understanding of her mother s actions into a new light entirely the community s social dynamics place a similar strain on our beliefs carl the community s selfserving philosopherking encounters a gaggle of newcomers who insist upon resolving issues by vote just like that the community evolves from a monarchy into a democracy a change that causes more problems than it solves as the majority begin to become tyrannical if you strip away its apocalyptic backdrop the novel presents fresh commentary about groupthink human psychology and governance by the end of it the situation makes you wonder if democracy will be the most effective way to survive the apocalypse otherworldly terrains at the outset of the novel when the community as a group are crossing a river they witness a loose log stripped naked of its bark and limbs bobb ing and roll ing past even though the nearby landscape was treeless later on agnes s friend celeste peel s back the moss in one wet green sheet and reveal s a notch in the rock from the notch a neonpink and when the community subsequently travel to the top of a caldera a round a bend the lakes emerged one black and one blue the closer they got the more the black one evolved into a deep murky green and the blue one became white like the clouded sky above it diane cook makes the wilderness feel as real and surreal as if you were living in it yourself in concert with the sharp rendering of social relations cook makes novels like hers can help us more deeply understand the estrangement and horror produced by each extreme weather pattern or mass extinction event we read about in the news in his book the great derangement climate change and the unthinkable amitav ghosh decries the ghettoization of climate change as a subject within the landscape of fiction it could even be said that fiction that deals with climate change is almost by definition not of the kind that is taken seriously by literary journals ghosh writes subject is often enough to relegate a novel or a short story to the genre of science fiction ghosh is right but with some caveats many wellregarded englishlanguage writers of literary fiction have tried their hand at clifi jg ballard s first three novelsthe wind from nowhere the drowned world and the burned worldenvision three different settings affected by three different climate change apocalypses tc boyle s a friend of the earth is set in a world in which the biosphere climate change as the backdrop for his novel solar none of the novels mentioned above are considered canonic novels in the careers of their authors as ghosh would argue they have been consigned to the category of clifi merely because of their subject matter and aren t ever compared to ballard s high rise boyle s the tortilla curtain or mcewan s atonement but this is changing now critics consider weather jenny offill s fragmented rumination on climate best works of englishlanguage fiction published this year john lanchester s climate change parable the wall was heralded as a timely work last year and diane cook has found herself on this year s booker prize short list what has precipitated clifi s acceptance by the mainstream literary establishment open a newspaper turn on the tv climate change is no longer a phenomenon for science fiction writers alone to envision we are living in a climatechanged world the city in diane cook or lahore or miami climate change fiction isn t a speculative genre anymoreit is quickly becoming its own form of literary realism well perhaps not quite realism maybe we should call it literary relativism as the phenomena are real but the places and people feeling the impact aren t supposed to be cook and others barely exaggerate what we re reading in the news but place these exaggerations within fictional universes making the gravity of what we re experiencing that much more constructed but the mechanics of the novel just like the mechanics of cook s short stories are those of a simple parable we have pushed the world to the point where we will soon have to change our way of life the lives that we will soon lead will test our morality our courage our sheer willingness to survive what sacrifices will we have to make to stay alive in the next years the next years will those sacrifices even</td>\n",

       "2  the way the end of days should be a story from diane cook s collection man v nature takes place in a flooded world the story s unnamed narrator defends their home from desperate strangers with the help of a man named gary the narrator s neighbor meanwhile houses every newcomer who washes up on his porchhe welcomes so many people in fact that his house begins to deteriorate no matter how bad things get for the neighbor and the refugees living in his house isolationist ways eventually gary abandons the narrator to help the neighbor and the narrator reacts by suspecting gary and the neighbor of conspiring against him we leave the narrator lingering near their front door a knife in each hand waiting to defend his home from a siege that may never come this story is a piece of climate change fiction or clifi sure but it s also a parable a morality tale about the decisions one must make apocalypse do you empathize with the survivalist narrator or his selfless neighbor how would you act if your neighborhood flooded tomorrow diane cook centers her stories around moral conundrums like this one as man v nature s title suggests cook forces readers to question the limits of their humanity in the face of extreme circumstancessupernatural environmental futuristic or a combination of the three cook s debut novel the new wilderness towers above the stories in her collection it takes people are struggling to survive in urban society referred to simply as the city a group of the most vulnerable citizens retreat to an area known as the wilderness to live in a nomadic huntergatherer place called the community our protagonist bea decides to join the community because her daughter agnes is sick if she and agnes don t leave the city for the wilderness agnes s death is all but assured the emotional core of the the relationship between bea and agnes the most intricate and morally arresting relationship cook has conjured to date bea has joined the community to save her daughter s life and yet bea has entered into an existence full of cultish polyamory grisly hunting expeditions the consumption of raw meat insects and rodents not to mention maiming and death when bea can t bear life in the community any longer and abandons agnes to return to the city cook switches from bea and in doing so forces us to challenge our conception of bea from the viewpoint of the daughter she abandoned agnes dismisses her mean mother who had run away the meanest of them all perhaps she d never been anything but a mean mother and every kiss had been cruel meant to eventually because pain with its absence in presenting both sides of the situation cook asks how can we morally balance the initial sacrifice with the later abandonment how much are action considering the brutality of life in the wilderness to which bea was exposed things only get more complicated after bea returns to the community and attempts to get back into her daughter s good graces agnes hated that her mind would not let her curl back into her mother would not let her run to her without a care or worry or resentment would not let her forget that cloud of dust her mother had disappeared into she fell asleep to the exhalation of and to the urgency of her own thrumming heart the relationship between mother and daughter continues to oscillate between caring and rejection love and hate as agnes matures and becomes a woman in her own right falls in love and begins to contemplate becoming a mother herself a process that throws her understanding of her mother s actions into a new light entirely the community s social dynamics place a similar strain on our beliefs carl the community s selfserving philosopherking encounters a gaggle of newcomers who insist upon resolving issues by vote just like that the community evolves from a monarchy into a democracy a change that causes more problems than it solves as the majority begin to become tyrannical if you strip away its apocalyptic backdrop the novel presents fresh commentary about groupthink human psychology and governance by the end of it the situation makes you wonder if democracy will be the most effective way to survive the apocalypse otherworldly terrains at the outset of the novel when the community as a group are crossing a river they witness a loose log stripped naked of its bark and limbs bobb ing and roll ing past even though the nearby landscape was treeless later on agnes s friend celeste peel s back the moss in one wet green sheet and reveal s a notch in the rock from the notch a neonpink and when the community subsequently travel to the top of a caldera a round a bend the lakes emerged one black and one blue the closer they got the more the black one evolved into a deep murky green and the blue one became white like the clouded sky above it diane cook makes the wilderness feel as real and surreal as if you were living in it yourself in concert with the sharp rendering of social relations cook makes novels like hers can help us more deeply understand the estrangement and horror produced by each extreme weather pattern or mass extinction event we read about in the news in his book the great derangement climate change and the unthinkable amitav ghosh decries the ghettoization of climate change as a subject within the landscape of fiction it could even be said that fiction that deals with climate change is almost by definition not of the kind that is taken seriously by literary journals ghosh writes subject is often enough to relegate a novel or a short story to the genre of science fiction ghosh is right but with some caveats many wellregarded englishlanguage writers of literary fiction have tried their hand at clifi jg ballard s first three novelsthe wind from nowhere the drowned world and the burned worldenvision three different settings affected by three different climate change apocalypses tc boyle s a friend of the earth is set in a world in which the biosphere climate change as the backdrop for his novel solar none of the novels mentioned above are considered canonic novels in the careers of their authors as ghosh would argue they have been consigned to the category of clifi merely because of their subject matter and aren t ever compared to ballard s high rise boyle s the tortilla curtain or mcewan s atonement but this is changing now critics consider weather jenny offill s fragmented rumination on climate best works of englishlanguage fiction published this year john lanchester s climate change parable the wall was heralded as a timely work last year and diane cook has found herself on this year s booker prize short list what has precipitated clifi s acceptance by the mainstream literary establishment open a newspaper turn on the tv climate change is no longer a phenomenon for science fiction writers alone to envision we are living in a climatechanged world the city in diane cook or lahore or miami climate change fiction isn t a speculative genre anymoreit is quickly becoming its own form of literary realism well perhaps not quite realism maybe we should call it literary relativism as the phenomena are real but the places and people feeling the impact aren t supposed to be cook and others barely exaggerate what we re reading in the news but place these exaggerations within fictional universes making the gravity of what we re experiencing that much more constructed but the mechanics of the novel just like the mechanics of cook s short stories are those of a simple parable we have pushed the world to the point

sunday increased pressure on russia over the poisoning of russian opposition politician alexei navalny warning that a lack of support by moscow in the investigation could force germany to rethink the fate of a germanrussian gas pipeline project i hope the russians won t force us to change our position regarding the nord stream pipeline being built under the baltic sea german foreign minister heiko maas told weekly bild am sonntag maas also said that if there won t be an investigation in the coming days we will have to consult with our partners he did not exclude possible punishments against russia telling the newspaper that if we think about sanctions they should be pinpointed effectively however maas also admitted that halting the building of the nearly completed gas pipeline would harm german and european companies whoever demands this has to be aware of the consequences he said more than companies from european countries are involved in the from germany the german government has come under growing pressure to use the joint germanrussian pipeline project as leverage in getting russia to provide answers on navalny the nord stream project would deliver russian gas directly to germany under the baltic sea when completed bypassing ukraine navalny a kremlin critic and corruption investigator fell ill on a flight to moscow last month and was taken to a hospital in the siberian city of omsk he has been in an induced coma in a berlin hospital treatment on august german authorities have said that tests showed that he had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the novichok group british authorities previously identified the nerve agent developed during the soviet era as the poison used on former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter in england in we have high expectations from the russians to bring light into this severe crime maas said if they have nothing to do with this attack then it s facts on the table president vladimir putin s spokesman has brushed off allegations that the kremlin was involved in poisoning navalny and said last week that germany hadn t provided moscow with any evidence about the politician s condition german chancellor angela merkel called navalny s poisoning an attempted murder that aimed to silence one of putin s fiercest critics and called for a full investigation merkel personally offered the country s assistance in treating navalny he s now in stable condition but doctors expect a long recovery and haven t ruled out that the yearold could face longterm effects to his health merkel has previously rejected the idea that the navalny case should be linked to the nord stream gas pipeline the yous has long opposed the project which has been increasingly a source of friction between berlin and washington in early august three republican senators threatened sanctions against an operator of a baltic sea port located in merkel s parliamentary constituency over its part in is a key staging post for ships involved in its construction the yous argues the project will endanger european security by making germany overly dependent on russian gas it s also opposed by ukraine and poland which will be bypassed by the pipeline under the baltic as well as some other european nations in addition to the security concerns the yous also wants to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas or lng to europe   \n",

       "      <td>the way the end of days should be a story from diane cook s collection man v nature takes place in a flooded world the story s unnamed narrator defends their home from desperate strangers with the help of a man named gary the narrator s neighbor meanwhile houses every newcomer who washes up on his porchhe welcomes so many people in fact that his house begins to deteriorate no matter how bad things get for the neighbor and the refugees living in his house isolationist ways eventually gary abandons the narrator to help the neighbor and the narrator reacts by suspecting gary and the neighbor of conspiring against him we leave the narrator lingering near their front door a knife in each hand waiting to defend his home from a siege that may never come this story is a piece of climate change fiction or clifi sure but it s also a parable a morality tale about the decisions one must make apocalypse do you empathize with the survivalist narrator or his selfless neighbor how would you act if your neighborhood flooded tomorrow diane cook centers her stories around moral conundrums like this one as man v nature s title suggests cook forces readers to question the limits of their humanity in the face of extreme circumstancessupernatural environmental futuristic or a combination of the three cook s debut novel the new wilderness towers above the stories in her collection it takes people are struggling to survive in urban society referred to simply as the city a group of the most vulnerable citizens retreat to an area known as the wilderness to live in a nomadic huntergatherer place called the community our protagonist bea decides to join the community because her daughter agnes is sick if she and agnes don t leave the city for the wilderness agnes s death is all but assured the emotional core of the the relationship between bea and agnes the most intricate and morally arresting relationship cook has conjured to date bea has joined the community to save her daughter s life and yet bea has entered into an existence full of cultish polyamory grisly hunting expeditions the consumption of raw meat insects and rodents not to mention maiming and death when bea can t bear life in the community any longer and abandons agnes to return to the city cook switches from bea and in doing so forces us to challenge our conception of bea from the viewpoint of the daughter she abandoned agnes dismisses her mean mother who had run away the meanest of them all perhaps she d never been anything but a mean mother and every kiss had been cruel meant to eventually because pain with its absence in presenting both sides of the situation cook asks how can we morally balance the initial sacrifice with the later abandonment how much are action considering the brutality of life in the wilderness to which bea was exposed things only get more complicated after bea returns to the community and attempts to get back into her daughter s good graces agnes hated that her mind would not let her curl back into her mother would not let her run to her without a care or worry or resentment would not let her forget that cloud of dust her mother had disappeared into she fell asleep to the exhalation of and to the urgency of her own thrumming heart the relationship between mother and daughter continues to oscillate between caring and rejection love and hate as agnes matures and becomes a woman in her own right falls in love and begins to contemplate becoming a mother herself a process that throws her understanding of her mother s actions into a new light entirely the community s social dynamics place a similar strain on our beliefs carl the community s selfserving philosopherking encounters a gaggle of newcomers who insist upon resolving issues by vote just like that the community evolves from a monarchy into a democracy a change that causes more problems than it solves as the majority begin to become tyrannical if you strip away its apocalyptic backdrop the novel presents fresh commentary about groupthink human psychology and governance by the end of it the situation makes you wonder if democracy will be the most effective way to survive the apocalypse otherworldly terrains at the outset of the novel when the community as a group are crossing a river they witness a loose log stripped naked of its bark and limbs bobb ing and roll ing past even though the nearby landscape was treeless later on agnes s friend celeste peel s back the moss in one wet green sheet and reveal s a notch in the rock from the notch a neonpink and when the community subsequently travel to the top of a caldera a round a bend the lakes emerged one black and one blue the closer they got the more the black one evolved into a deep murky green and the blue one became white like the clouded sky above it diane cook makes the wilderness feel as real and surreal as if you were living in it yourself in concert with the sharp rendering of social relations cook makes novels like hers can help us more deeply understand the estrangement and horror produced by each extreme weather pattern or mass extinction event we read about in the news in his book the great derangement climate change and the unthinkable amitav ghosh decries the ghettoization of climate change as a subject within the landscape of fiction it could even be said that fiction that deals with climate change is almost by definition not of the kind that is taken seriously by literary journals ghosh writes subject is often enough to relegate a novel or a short story to the genre of science fiction ghosh is right but with some caveats many wellregarded englishlanguage writers of literary fiction have tried their hand at clifi jg ballard s first three novelsthe wind from nowhere the drowned world and the burned worldenvision three different settings affected by three different climate change apocalypses tc boyle s a friend of the earth is set in a world in which the biosphere climate change as the backdrop for his novel solar none of the novels mentioned above are considered canonic novels in the careers of their authors as ghosh would argue they have been consigned to the category of clifi merely because of their subject matter and aren t ever compared to ballard s high rise boyle s the tortilla curtain or mcewan s atonement but this is changing now critics consider weather jenny offill s fragmented rumination on climate best works of englishlanguage fiction published this year john lanchester s climate change parable the wall was heralded as a timely work last year and diane cook has found herself on this year s booker prize short list what has precipitated clifi s acceptance by the mainstream literary establishment open a newspaper turn on the tv climate change is no longer a phenomenon for science fiction writers alone to envision we are living in a climatechanged world the city in diane cook or lahore or miami climate change fiction isn t a speculative genre anymoreit is quickly becoming its own form of literary realism well perhaps not quite realism maybe we should call it literary relativism as the phenomena are real but the places and people feeling the impact aren t supposed to be cook and others barely exaggerate what we re reading in the news but place these exaggerations within fictional universes making the gravity of what we re experiencing that much more constructed but the mechanics of the novel just like the mechanics of cook s short stories are those of a simple parable we have pushed the world to the point where we will soon have to change our way of life the lives that we will soon lead will test our morality our courage our sheer willingness to survive what sacrifices will we have to make to stay alive in the next years the next years will those sacrifices even</td>\n",

       "2  the way the end of days should be a story from diane cook s collection man v nature takes place in a flooded world the story s unnamed narrator defends their home from desperate strangers with the help of a man named gary the narrator s neighbor meanwhile houses every newcomer who washes up on his porchhe welcomes so many people in fact that his house begins to deteriorate no matter how bad things get for the neighbor and the refugees living in his house isolationist ways eventually gary abandons the narrator to help the neighbor and the narrator reacts by suspecting gary and the neighbor of conspiring against him we leave the narrator lingering near their front door a knife in each hand waiting to defend his home from a siege that may never come this story is a piece of climate change fiction or clifi sure but it s also a parable a morality tale about the decisions one must make apocalypse do you empathize with the survivalist narrator or his selfless neighbor how would you act if your neighborhood flooded tomorrow diane cook centers her stories around moral conundrums like this one as man v nature s title suggests cook forces readers to question the limits of their humanity in the face of extreme circumstancessupernatural environmental futuristic or a combination of the three cook s debut novel the new wilderness towers above the stories in her collection it takes people are struggling to survive in urban society referred to simply as the city a group of the most vulnerable citizens retreat to an area known as the wilderness to live in a nomadic huntergatherer place called the community our protagonist bea decides to join the community because her daughter agnes is sick if she and agnes don t leave the city for the wilderness agnes s death is all but assured the emotional core of the the relationship between bea and agnes the most intricate and morally arresting relationship cook has conjured to date bea has joined the community to save her daughter s life and yet bea has entered into an existence full of cultish polyamory grisly hunting expeditions the consumption of raw meat insects and rodents not to mention maiming and death when bea can t bear life in the community any longer and abandons agnes to return to the city cook switches from bea and in doing so forces us to challenge our conception of bea from the viewpoint of the daughter she abandoned agnes dismisses her mean mother who had run away the meanest of them all perhaps she d never been anything but a mean mother and every kiss had been cruel meant to eventually because pain with its absence in presenting both sides of the situation cook asks how can we morally balance the initial sacrifice with the later abandonment how much are action considering the brutality of life in the wilderness to which bea was exposed things only get more complicated after bea returns to the community and attempts to get back into her daughter s good graces agnes hated that her mind would not let her curl back into her mother would not let her run to her without a care or worry or resentment would not let her forget that cloud of dust her mother had disappeared into she fell asleep to the exhalation of and to the urgency of her own thrumming heart the relationship between mother and daughter continues to oscillate between caring and rejection love and hate as agnes matures and becomes a woman in her own right falls in love and begins to contemplate becoming a mother herself a process that throws her understanding of her mother s actions into a new light entirely the community s social dynamics place a similar strain on our beliefs carl the community s selfserving philosopherking encounters a gaggle of newcomers who insist upon resolving issues by vote just like that the community evolves from a monarchy into a democracy a change that causes more problems than it solves as the majority begin to become tyrannical if you strip away its apocalyptic backdrop the novel presents fresh commentary about groupthink human psychology and governance by the end of it the situation makes you wonder if democracy will be the most effective way to survive the apocalypse otherworldly terrains at the outset of the novel when the community as a group are crossing a river they witness a loose log stripped naked of its bark and limbs bobb ing and roll ing past even though the nearby landscape was treeless later on agnes s friend celeste peel s back the moss in one wet green sheet and reveal s a notch in the rock from the notch a neonpink and when the community subsequently travel to the top of a caldera a round a bend the lakes emerged one black and one blue the closer they got the more the black one evolved into a deep murky green and the blue one became white like the clouded sky above it diane cook makes the wilderness feel as real and surreal as if you were living in it yourself in concert with the sharp rendering of social relations cook makes novels like hers can help us more deeply understand the estrangement and horror produced by each extreme weather pattern or mass extinction event we read about in the news in his book the great derangement climate change and the unthinkable amitav ghosh decries the ghettoization of climate change as a subject within the landscape of fiction it could even be said that fiction that deals with climate change is almost by definition not of the kind that is taken seriously by literary journals ghosh writes subject is often enough to relegate a novel or a short story to the genre of science fiction ghosh is right but with some caveats many wellregarded englishlanguage writers of literary fiction have tried their hand at clifi jg ballard s first three novelsthe wind from nowhere the drowned world and the burned worldenvision three different settings affected by three different climate change apocalypses tc boyle s a friend of the earth is set in a world in which the biosphere climate change as the backdrop for his novel solar none of the novels mentioned above are considered canonic novels in the careers of their authors as ghosh would argue they have been consigned to the category of clifi merely because of their subject matter and aren t ever compared to ballard s high rise boyle s the tortilla curtain or mcewan s atonement but this is changing now critics consider weather jenny offill s fragmented rumination on climate best works of englishlanguage fiction published this year john lanchester s climate change parable the wall was heralded as a timely work last year and diane cook has found herself on this year s booker prize short list what has precipitated clifi s acceptance by the mainstream literary establishment open a newspaper turn on the tv climate change is no longer a phenomenon for science fiction writers alone to envision we are living in a climatechanged world the city in diane cook or lahore or miami climate change fiction isn t a speculative genre anymoreit is quickly becoming its own form of literary realism well perhaps not quite realism maybe we should call it literary relativism as the phenomena are real but the places and people feeling the impact aren t supposed to be cook and others barely exaggerate what we re reading in the news but place these exaggerations within fictional universes making the gravity of what we re experiencing that much more constructed but the mechanics of the novel just like the mechanics of cook s short stories are those of a simple parable we have pushed the world to the point where we will soon have to change our way of life the lives that we will soon lead will test our morality our courage our sheer willingness to survive what sacrifices will we have to make to stay alive in the next years the next years will those sacrifices even   \n",

sunday increased pressure on russia over the poisoning of russian opposition politician alexei navalny warning that a lack of support by moscow in the investigation could force germany to rethink the fate of a germanrussian gas pipeline project i hope the russians won t force us to change our position regarding the nord stream pipeline being built under the baltic sea german foreign minister heiko maas told weekly bild am sonntag maas also said that if there won t be an investigation in the coming days we will have to consult with our partners he did not exclude possible punishments against russia telling the newspaper that if we think about sanctions they should be pinpointed effectively however maas also admitted that halting the building of the nearly completed gas pipeline would harm german and european companies whoever demands this has to be aware of the consequences he said more than companies from european countries are involved in the from germany the german government has come under growing pressure to use the joint germanrussian pipeline project as leverage in getting russia to provide answers on navalny the nord stream project would deliver russian gas directly to germany under the baltic sea when completed bypassing ukraine navalny a kremlin critic and corruption investigator fell ill on a flight to moscow last month and was taken to a hospital in the siberian city of omsk he has been in an induced coma in a berlin hospital treatment on august german authorities have said that tests showed that he had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the novichok group british authorities previously identified the nerve agent developed during the soviet era as the poison used on former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter in england in we have high expectations from the russians to bring light into this severe crime maas said if they have nothing to do with this attack then it s facts on the table president vladimir putin s spokesman has brushed off allegations that the kremlin was involved in poisoning navalny and said last week that germany hadn t provided moscow with any evidence about the politician s condition german chancellor angela merkel called navalny s poisoning an attempted murder that aimed to silence one of putin s fiercest critics and called for a full investigation merkel personally offered the country s assistance in treating navalny he s now in stable condition but doctors expect a long recovery and haven t ruled out that the yearold could face longterm effects to his health merkel has previously rejected the idea that the navalny case should be linked to the nord stream gas pipeline the yous has long opposed the project which has been increasingly a source of friction between berlin and washington in early august three republican senators threatened sanctions against an operator of a baltic sea port located in merkel s parliamentary constituency over its part in is a key staging post for ships involved in its construction the yous argues the project will endanger european security by making germany overly dependent on russian gas it s also opposed by ukraine and poland which will be bypassed by the pipeline under the baltic as well as some other european nations in addition to the security concerns the yous also wants to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas or lng to

       "      <td>russia is still grappling with the foreign policy implications of a biden presidency one week after the presidential election russian president vladimir putin is among a handful of global leaders who have not congratulated joe biden on his projected election victory over president donald trump earlier this week kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov explained the reasoning behind the kremlin s decision we think it appropriate to wait for the official vote count said peskov in a conference call with reporters asked why the kremlin did not follow the same procedure after the election peskov noted that the circumstances are different you can see that there are certain legal procedures that have been announced by the current president that is why the situations are different and we therefore think it appropriate to wait for an official announcement peskov reiterated the position espoused by kremlin officials and vladimir putin over the course of october that moscow is prepared to work with either of the two candidates pending the outcome of the election as moscow continues commentary sphere remains divided over the election there is a sizable contingent of analysts and politicians who worry that a president biden based on his election rhetoric and his tenure in the obama administration would escalate washington s policy of rollback against russia the russian publication vzglyad argued that a biden presidency would not only be bad news for russia for the usual reasonsamong them more sanctions further military support for ukraine and pushing for the nato accession of more postsoviet states on russia balance of power against russia by reconciling with the european union and pursuing rapprochement with china at moscow s expense economist andrei nechaev added that a biden administration is more likely to confront russia on the basis of clashing values democrats are traditionally more concerned with human rights civil rights and so on that gives yet another reason for tougher sanctions as russia gives grounds for sanctions on that basis russian politician elena panina offered an assessment along broadly likely sees a threat in the values that are important to russia as reflected in our updated constitution respect for religion culture history and defense of the traditional family still others see traces of a silver lining russian politicians show tepid optimism over the survival of new start and iranian nuclear deal biden promised if elected to extend the new start treaty and return the us to the iran nuclear deal biden stridently opposed russia at the munich conference obama policy line but these two steps are very important for strategic stability and preventing war with iran noted russian senator aleksei pushkov senator and chair of the foreign affairs committee of the federation council konstantin kosachev echoed pushkov s assessment the iran deal is the brainchild of barack obama if biden wins he will try to show that republican donald trump s foreign policy was wholly wrong there is likewise a belief in moscow echoed by some in is unlikely to continue trump s policy line of trying to stop the nord stream pipeline between russia and germany instead many predict that he is willing to trade washington s acquiescence to the pipeline in exchange for german economic concessions elsewhere but russian commentators are as interested in the process of the election as they are in the outcome there is a prevalent strain of thinking espoused everywhere from the ruling united russia party to conservative opposition figures that biden s mandate of voter fraud and the refusal of many of those who voted against him to recognize the legitimacy of the election it seems that there is already one loserthe process itself and with it democracy said kosachev scandals strange flipping of states lost and stuffed ballots positions taken by the media and other unseemly episodes have not put the electoral process in the best light kosachev joined other russian commentators in outlining what he sees as washington s double standards americans themselves would have harshly criticized similar occurrences if they had happened in other countries including the nonrecognition of results as noted by vzglyad the rampant polarization of american politics and americans widespread loss of faith in yous institutions threatens to undermine biden s ability to conduct policy particularly foreign policy visavis russiaeffectively russian commentators have also seized on accusations of electoral misconduct to argue that the united states is not in a position to lecture others about democracy and political transparency chairman of the state show is being called an example of democracy moreover they suggest that it is a standard for democracy i don t think it s a standard volodin went on to criticize the electoral college and the twoparty system before concluding that russia s electoral framework is more transparent more effective and more legitimate with the kremlin set to congratulate the winner following the final vote tally and certification process it remains to be seen how the

       "      <td>washington cnn when president donald trump revealed his guidelines for opening up america again last week among the bolded names of businesses and institutions that could reopen were restaurants movie theaters and places of worship so long as they adhered to strict social distancing protocols tucked near the bottom of the list right above a warning that bars should stay closed was a curious inclusion gyms while an integral part of many americans routines gyms and fitness clubs would seem to present a particular risk for filled with people sweating and breathing hard sharing equipment and spaces gyms are in many ways the last kind of business to prioritize during a deadly pandemic their inclusion follows a lastminute lobbying push by an industry not known for flexing its muscles in washington while not every major company was part of the effort conversations with leaders in the fitnessclub business reveal an influential network of relationships that kicked into gear over the past few weeks and helped move gyms to the front of the line in the industry noteworthy figures in the effort include a trumploving fitnesscenter owner in pennsylvania rudy giuliani s son andrew billionaire realestate mogul steve ross and the us surgeon general among the most influential advocates is an iranianborn founder of one of the country s largest fitness club chains bahram akradi of life time fitness akradi has been pitching governors and the trump administration on what he calls a comprehensive multifaceted tactical plan to fight the coronavirus and rebuild the economy he now economic recovery working groups and in conference calls with the president himself including on the day before trump released his new guidelines we just really lucked out and were able to get our message into a couple of the right people s hands said meredith poppler a top official at the international health racquet and sportsclub association the industry s main trade group poppler told cnn that in recent weeks ihrsa which receives funding from many of the brandname gym companies began economic fallout hitting gyms and fitness clubs that included hiring more lobbyists and aggressively pressing its message about the importance of physical fitness during a pandemic to lawmakers in washington as well as officials in the trump administration the messaging worked even better than they would hoped we were as surprised as anyone when we saw president trump announce the three phases and that gyms were in the first phase said poppler the day before trump announced his plan at his daily press briefing the executives from various industries to talk about reopening the country on the call were akradi and ross who in addition to his realestate empire is a part owner of luxury fitness companies equinox and soulcycle an outsized presence for the relatively small fitnessclub industry akradi insists there was no talk on that call about including gyms in the first group of opened businesses everybody talked about their employees taking care of their people akradi said we never discussed gyms a stephen ross never discussed gyms exercise clubs or anything like that with the president and any implication otherwise is factually incorrect garbage said jon weinstein of related companies the real estate firm founded and partially owned by ross another key figure is jim worthington a board member at ihrsa and something of a trump superfan the owner of two gyms in pennsylvania and one in new jersey worthington was tapped for a spot on the president s council on sports fitness and also the founder of the pac peopletrump whose website features photos of worthington at the president s inauguration in january in an interview worthington told cnn he has been working with several people within the administration on gymrelated issues the first is andrew giuliani the son of former new york city mayor and trump attorney rudy giuliani andrew is an official in the white house office of public liaison and worthington says he worked with giuliani to try to allow large multilocation exception afforded to chain restaurants in the recently passed smallbusiness payer protection loan program worthington says the issue is one congress not the white house has to resolve worthington said he has communicated his concerns about the industry through kristina harder the executive director on the presidential fitness council and a former top aide to assistant secretary for health brett giroir according to a former health and human services official harder is also close with the team around ivanka trump on behalf of with jerome adams the surgeon general for feedback on guidelines health clubs should follow to ensure they are in compliance with cdc regulations a spokeswoman for the surgeon general confirmed that adams told worthington he would be happy to review any such guidelines worthington said he ca nt take full credit for the inclusion of gyms in phase one i think it s been a collective effort he told cnn i think there s been a handful of people and not but i may be one of them there are some with serious concerns that gyms that open in phase one could become vectors for the virus just as the outbreak might otherwise be winding down one of them is dr saju mathew a family medicine specialist in atlanta georgia who studied public health at emory university how are they going to make sure that people work out where they are six feet apart from each other at all times are they going to only let a lot of health and safety concerns and then locker rooms could be even a bigger issue mathew told cnn many of the gym executives that spoke to cnn said they have been busy planning how they will reopen and trying to do so carefully the accelerated timeline in georgia they said means many are unlikely to be ready to reopen facilities there on friday a spokesperson for planet fitness told cnn there is no set date for reopening their clubs in georgia fitness will reopen some franchised georgia locations on may the company confirmed to cnn in a statement and some executives who spoke to cnn expressed some hesitance at a lack of federal guidance dictating what measures they should follow when they reopen adam zeitsiff the ceo of gold s gym said that even in mongolia where gold s gym also operates the government has mandated distances between members a quota capacity for gyms and guidelines about testing employees there still has nt as to how we are going to reopen zeitsiff said every gym executive cnn spoke with said they had been working to develop companywide standards for cleaning and social distancing measures to keep members safe when they do reopen zeitsiff said that during phase one employees will be asked to wear a mask and gloves and people will be assigned to monitor who is using what machine going in and cleaning after members clean themselves they also plan to temperature check employees other gym fitness said they plan to use their company app to check people into their clubs with less contact between members and employees including eliminating touchscreen checkin machines hour fitness said they plan to open their gyms in minute sessions through the day followed by a minute closed gym cleaning period according to a statement they provided to cnn jim rowley ceo of crunch global said part of their procedures when reopening will be to use the gym app in order to limit class sizes for are also considering using it to check members in since closing crunch gyms rowley says his staff has been working on a page manual on their procedures for reopening the franchise is investing in special cleaning methods and hiring more staff to handle the increased cleaning demand we are spending and this is the tough part rowley said we do nt have any revenue but we are having to spend money to reopen on labor hiring new staff members buying products that are more expensive thinking about safety anthony geisler ceo and founder of xponential fitness which manages eight boutique fitness chains including the popular row house pure barre and club pilates said he believes boutique fitness studios are safer to reopen than big gym franchises because they are often smaller spaces and that it will be easier to track people taking classes if someone were to become sick there s a massive difference between a gym like a big box geisler told cnn mathew said gyms with large numbers of people coming in and out of the building is likely going to be a huge health hazard you can imagine in a gym setting if you just traced people from weight to weight if one person is infected he or she can infect three or four people around them and then the chain begins mathew said correction and update this

       "      <td>care and feeding is slate s parenting advice column have a question for care and feeding submit it here or post it in the slate parenting facebook group i have a yearold son who is in fourth grade i feel as though he is at an age where it s appropriate to start introducing more mature topics or at least signaling our openness as parents to his questions about those topics i m thinking about anything from puberty sex and substances to peer pressure race and violence have a great relationship otherwise my son completely closes up when either my husband or i try to initiate conversations about these topics for example he told us recently that the gym teachers at school gave kids the puberty talk when i gently ask followup questions how do you feel about that or are the kids on the bus talking about sex he gets uncomfortable clams up and changes the subject last night we watched a the topic of racial discrimination i casually tried to use that as a springboard to start a conversation and he shut down he is an advanced and voracious reader and i know he s read books that include mature themes involving sex race or violence but when i ask him if he has questions or about what he learns and takes away from what he reads he s not interested in discussing it i have started resorting to saying anytime talk about something please come talk to dad or me i ve gotten to the point that i ve even bribed him by withholding something he wants like a dessert or screen time until he tells me say one thing his friends are saying about sex or one question he has about it this topic in particular is an important one to me as i want him to grow up in a sexpositive household and to understand the meaning of consent was raised as he gets older i imagine that he ll be exposed to more quite likely biased or inaccurate information from peers i don t want to alienate him by being too pushy but i m concerned that if he doesn t open up we won t have the opportunity to correct misinformation or educate him he is not especially introspective so i can t tell whether he genuinely doesn t have questions or if he talk about it i think it s a bit of both i guess i m wondering in what ways we should continue to attempt these conversations as he gets older do you have any suggestions on how to get him to open up open your heart to me i am sure you know this but you need to back way way off the bribing is not in fact bribing it s actually punishing him don information in their own time and in their own way and it sounds like he s a reader and a quiet thinker buy him good books about the things you are so desperate to talk to him about he knows you re there if he has questions oh boy does he ever and he s only i think you re trying to aggressively push the envelope on a lot of these issues i felt overwhelmed just reading your t feel like his parents are emotionally dependent on him to have the conversations you wish you d had when you were growing up you can have a sexpositive household without needing him to talk about it your job is to display daily through your actions and words the values you hold dear let the young lad be maybe he ll come to you maybe he ll work it out on his own a lot of parents find that kids when they don t have to make eye contact in the process he may also be more comfortable coming to his father with a lot of this so make sure your husband is also signaling his availability but not his desperation to have the big talks just take a breath for now i m not sure what to do about a year ago i lost my pregnancy at weeks it was devastating for both my husband and me where we would like to start trying again we both still want to have children however i did have some infertility issues and last time it took a little over two years to get pregnant and now i just can t seem to bring myself to talk to my doctor about this i feel embarrassed to even admit that i want to get pregnant again when it didn t work out the first time we did all the genetic testing available to make sure defective gene and everything came back negative it was just a fluke but what should i do just wait and hope that nature will take its course and i eventually get pregnant again or should i suck it up and seek help and has anyone else felt embarrassed talking about infertility or is it simply intensifying our loss i m so sorry for your loss twentythree weeks is an agonizing time to lose a muchwanted pregnancy and there really aren t any good s an exact replica of a figment of my imagination which is a very sad and deeply profound account of a similar experience and will at the very least make you feel less alone it does very little good to tell people experiencing infertility or the horrific aftermath of a stillbirth don t feel embarrassed don t feel like this is your fault because your feelings are your feelings and attempting to replace them with more productive feelings is just going re failing at something else talk to your doctor and consider asking for a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist if nature taking its course doesn t pan out explore your options seek support from one of the many online groups and message boards from people who have been through what you have been through reddit s rinfertility subreddit is very good be honest with your partner be kind to yourself if you missed sunday s care discuss this column in the slate parenting facebook group my yearold son has been pretty responsible for his whole life he always gets his homework done and turned in on time rarely loses things and does his chores without being asked however he got his braces off about seven months ago and is already on his fourth retainer as far as i ve seen he s using his case but he has returned home from school twice holding a broken lost it we have given him punishments when he loses them and praise when he doesn t for a little while but we need a better solution we can t keep paying for new retainers in addition to having him go a week with no retainer while it s being made what should we do he s i know it feels like you re setting a stack of money on fire all that orthodontia down the drain honestly do not know what you can do that you are not doing sit him down write down how much money you have spent on his mouth to date tell him you are willing to get him exactly one more retainer and after that he s on his own when he s an adult he can decide if he wants to invest in his teeth or not he s had a lot of dental work already so i doubt that he major problems by all means have your dentist lecture him if you have not already tried that if he loses some or all of the cosmetic benefits from his braces well that s his choice my parents were never able to afford braces for us and for most people in the world braces are a luxury item you got him the damn braces so you have my permission to throw up your hands and let him deal with the consequences of losing anxiety is too much dan kois jamilah lemieux and elizabeth newcamp host this week s episode of slate s parenting podcast mom and dad are fighting my husband works at a company with offices all over the country and has a highup job his company moves him around up to twice a year he insists we all come with him on every move which i m not against since he is close with our kids and it wouldn t be else for long stretches of time however my oldest kid a seventh grader has been to different schools since kindergarten and my first grader who is on her third school since kindergarten has been so affected by the moves that she can barely read the fourth grader isn t doing so well either he still can t read very well because of a weak early elementary foundation and has not mastered multiplication tables yet they also rarely have best of all of the moves we still have a toddler and we are planning on another baby when the toddler s in kindergarten or first grade but what can i do to negate the effect of all of these moves on my children s education and social life i am going to completely ignore the current news cycle and treat this like i would if you sent it last year this is absolutely ridiculous you can not do this it is having a terrible a partnership military families do not move with this kind of frequency and also receive far more practical support with the ensuing transitions while you are having to make everything up on the fly you need to sit your husband down and tell him what you ve just told me and that you need to have a permanent home for your family he may have to change jobs he may have to be a parttime dad but he can not put this burden on him like ducks the last thing i want is to tell anyone to shake up their employment situation right now but you can say hey we are simply unable to keep this up we ve done all the moving we can do where do we go from here this may not be a fun conversation but it is checks watch long overdue i am an only child to a mother who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness put her in some kind of outofhome care but we can t afford it the most we can manage is inhome health care essentially hospice which is covered by her insurance we have two kids ages and and we worry about the impact of this experience on them will they be traumatized or horrified by seeing the end of life will it put too much stress on the household in general</td>\n",

       "      <td>tamarac floridaformer vice president joe biden s political longevity depends on days like this days when the party appears to be lining up behind him when he appears strong energized and ready to take on president trump and his monster political and fundraising organization biden s cycle of good news in the wake of his massive south carolina victory began sunday night with former south bend mayor pete buttigieg s decision to leave the race by day s end monday biden had buttigieg s support along dallas from former rivals sen amy klobuchar dmn who ended her own presidential run monday and former texas rep beto o rourke klobuchar joked it was wonderful to be standing next to biden on stage like this instead of facing off in a debate amy won all the debates biden told the crowd later and i m sure glad i wasn t on stage debating you again amy the younger generation that tried to beat biden folks this is a team we need your help biden called to the crowd after klobuchar and o rourke had sung his praises optimism has reigned in biden s campaign as he launched from the south carolina victory a sense of direction that pushed past super tuesday states and into the delegaterich state of florida the winnowing of the field continues biden s recent resurgence but it also cuts into former new york city mayor mike bloomberg s case frontrunner campaign presented bloomberg with an opportunity to enter the race at the eleventh hour last year the billionaire may now be the last moderate rival biden has to box out in the fluid race as the day began some voters in florida remained undecided as they waited to make their voices heard biden s performance in south carolina largely swayed yearold bruce nathanson to the democrat s side that support is soft however and he s left room to back bloomberg support the guy who s going to get the most votes on the moderate side he said if it s a super blowout for bloomberg i probably would go bloomberg nathanson said of super tuesday in florida television advertising and the strength of bloomberg s massive campaign operation could loom large but biden s campaign appears to be betting that getting democrats like rep debbie wasserman schultz dfl off the sidelines will shore up the support he needs sen bernie sanders ivt progressive revolution speaking at an organizing event in broward county wasserman schultz echoed what has become biden supporters consistent message of late he knows you he s struggled he cares about health care and he knows about heartbreak the resilience of this man is striking wasserman schultz told a crowd monday morning it really is whether that will be enough to win out over a bloomberg barrage aimed at the same crowd case study in whether a national profile can contend with freewheeling campaign spending i don t know that the democratic party is one where you can just put a lot of ads out and spend a lot of money said yearold biden supporter jennifer martin a moderate biden supporter i don t think that s the message that democrats believe in the prospect of a contested convention remains and florida s delegate haul is a substantial store of support for the the state s march primary leslie sills a yearold executive chef and pastry chef already backs biden and voiced his anger at trump as he stood outside the biden campaign s monday morning event but bloomberg spending his wealth on the race didn t bother sills in the slightest if i had the money bloomberg has i d be going for president myself he said bloomberg will be in florida on super tuesday campaigning in see if his unique approach of ignoring the first four states in favor of a major super tuesday push is indeed the kind of standards breaking political move his campaign has trumpeted it to be his campaign touted its florida operation in a press release monday morning boasting that the former mayor s state campaign is stronger than ever no other campaign has a bigger footprint in florida bloomberg s florida state director scott kosanovich said in the release for months knocking thousands of doors weekly talking to voters about mike s record on climate change gun safety and health care floridians know mike is the best candidate to defeat donald trump even at the biden organizing event wasserman schultz spoke at on monday bloomberg continued to be an enticing option for some the hunger to beat trump is as ferocious as ever and discomfort over the frontrunner sanders from some in the moderate base of the party is evident amma said she s struggling to decide between biden and bloomberg the former mayor may have a better chance in florida s general election she said he was a republican and florida s a republican state she said other more enthusiastic biden supporters have already had enough of bloomberg in one case a volunteer mirrored an attack on the former new york city mayor that sen elizabeth warren dma used to raise her campaign s profile in the

one week after the presidential election russian president vladimir putin is among a handful of global leaders who have not congratulated joe biden on his projected election victory over president donald trump earlier this week kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov explained the reasoning behind the kremlin s decision we think it appropriate to wait for the official vote count said peskov in a conference call with reporters asked why the kremlin did not follow the same procedure after the election peskov noted that the circumstances are different you can see that there are certain legal procedures that have been announced by the current president that is why the situations are different and we therefore think it appropriate to wait for an official announcement peskov reiterated the position espoused by kremlin officials and vladimir putin over the course of october that moscow is prepared to work with either of the two candidates pending the outcome of the election as moscow continues commentary sphere remains divided over the election there is a sizable contingent of analysts and politicians who worry that a president biden based on his election rhetoric and his tenure in the obama administration would escalate washington s policy of rollback against russia the russian publication vzglyad argued that a biden presidency would not only be bad news for russia for the usual reasonsamong them more sanctions further military support for ukraine and pushing for the nato accession of more postsoviet states on russia balance of power against russia by reconciling with the european union and pursuing rapprochement with china at moscow s expense economist andrei nechaev added that a biden administration is more likely to confront russia on the basis of clashing values democrats are traditionally more concerned with human rights civil rights and so on that gives yet another reason for tougher sanctions as russia gives grounds for sanctions on that basis russian politician elena panina offered an assessment along broadly likely sees a threat in the values that are important to russia as reflected in our updated constitution respect for religion culture history and defense of the traditional family still others see traces of a silver lining russian politicians show tepid optimism over the survival of new start and iranian nuclear deal biden promised if elected to extend the new start treaty and return the us to the iran nuclear deal biden stridently opposed russia at the munich conference obama policy line but these two steps are very important for strategic stability and preventing war with iran noted russian senator aleksei pushkov senator and chair of the foreign affairs committee of the federation council konstantin kosachev echoed pushkov s assessment the iran deal is the brainchild of barack obama if biden wins he will try to show that republican donald trump s foreign policy was wholly wrong there is likewise a belief in moscow echoed by some in is unlikely to continue trump s policy line of trying to stop the nord stream pipeline between russia and germany instead many predict that he is willing to trade washington s acquiescence to the pipeline in exchange for german economic concessions elsewhere but russian commentators are as interested in the process of the election as they are in the outcome there is a prevalent strain of thinking espoused everywhere from the ruling united russia party to conservative opposition figures that biden s mandate of voter fraud and the refusal of many of those who voted against him to recognize the legitimacy of the election it seems that there is already one loserthe process itself and with it democracy said kosachev scandals strange flipping of states lost and stuffed ballots positions taken by the media and other unseemly episodes have not put the electoral process in the best light kosachev joined other russian commentators in outlining what he sees as washington s double standards americans themselves would have harshly criticized similar occurrences if they had happened in other countries including the nonrecognition of results as noted by vzglyad the rampant polarization of american politics and americans widespread loss of faith in yous institutions threatens to undermine biden s ability to conduct policy particularly foreign policy visavis russiaeffectively russian commentators have also seized on accusations of electoral misconduct to argue that the united states is not in a position to lecture others about democracy and political transparency chairman of the state show is being called an example of democracy moreover they suggest that it is a standard for democracy i don t think it s a standard volodin went on to criticize the electoral college and the twoparty system before concluding that russia s electoral framework is more transparent more effective and more legitimate with the kremlin set to congratulate the winner following the final vote tally and certification process it remains to be seen how the vast breadth of russian political mark episkopos is a national security reporter for the national interest   \n",

                                                           washington cnn when president donald trump revealed his guidelines for opening up america again last week among the bolded names of businesses and institutions that could reopen were restaurants movie theaters and places of worship so long as they adhered to strict social distancing protocols tucked near the bottom of the list right above a warning that bars should stay closed was a curious inclusion gyms while an integral part of many americans routines gyms and fitness clubs would seem to present a particular risk for filled with people sweating and breathing hard sharing equipment and spaces gyms are in many ways the last kind of business to prioritize during a deadly pandemic their inclusion follows a lastminute lobbying push by an industry not known for flexing its muscles in washington while not every major company was part of the effort conversations with leaders in the fitnessclub business reveal an influential network of relationships that kicked into gear over the past few weeks and helped move gyms to the front of the line in the industry noteworthy figures in the effort include a trumploving fitnesscenter owner in pennsylvania rudy giuliani s son andrew billionaire realestate mogul steve ross and the us surgeon general among the most influential advocates is an iranianborn founder of one of the country s largest fitness club chains bahram akradi of life time fitness akradi has been pitching governors and the trump administration on what he calls a comprehensive multifaceted tactical plan to fight the coronavirus and rebuild the economy he now economic recovery working groups and in conference calls with the president himself including on the day before trump released his new guidelines we just really lucked out and were able to get our message into a couple of the right people s hands said meredith poppler a top official at the international health racquet and sportsclub association the industry s main trade group poppler told cnn that in recent weeks ihrsa which receives funding from many of the brandname gym companies began economic fallout hitting gyms and fitness clubs that included hiring more lobbyists and aggressively pressing its message about the importance of physical fitness during a pandemic to lawmakers in washington as well as officials in the trump administration the messaging worked even better than they would hoped we were as surprised as anyone when we saw president trump announce the three phases and that gyms were in the first phase said poppler the day before trump announced his plan at his daily press briefing the executives from various industries to talk about reopening the country on the call were akradi and ross who in addition to his realestate empire is a part owner of luxury fitness companies equinox and soulcycle an outsized presence for the relatively small fitnessclub industry akradi insists there was no talk on that call about including gyms in the first group of opened businesses everybody talked about their employees taking care of their people akradi said we never discussed gyms a stephen ross never discussed gyms exercise clubs or anything like that with the president and any implication otherwise is factually incorrect garbage said jon weinstein of related companies the real estate firm founded and partially owned by ross another key figure is jim worthington a board member at ihrsa and something of a trump superfan the owner of two gyms in pennsylvania and one in new jersey worthington was tapped for a spot on the president s council on sports fitness and also the founder of the pac peopletrump whose website features photos of worthington at the president s inauguration in january in an interview worthington told cnn he has been working with several people within the administration on gymrelated issues the first is andrew giuliani the son of former new york city mayor and trump attorney rudy giuliani andrew is an official in the white house office of public liaison and worthington says he worked with giuliani to try to allow large multilocation exception afforded to chain restaurants in the recently passed smallbusiness payer protection loan program worthington says the issue is one congress not the white house has to resolve worthington said he has communicated his concerns about the industry through kristina harder the executive director on the presidential fitness council and a former top aide to assistant secretary for health brett giroir according to a former health and human services official harder is also close with the team around ivanka trump on behalf of with jerome adams the surgeon general for feedback on guidelines health clubs should follow to ensure they are in compliance with cdc regulations a spokeswoman for the surgeon general confirmed that adams told worthington he would be happy to review any such guidelines worthington said he ca nt take full credit for the inclusion of gyms in phase one i think it s been a collective effort he told cnn i think there s been a handful of people and not but i may be one of them there are some with serious concerns that gyms that open in phase one could become vectors for the virus just as the outbreak might otherwise be winding down one of them is dr saju mathew a family medicine specialist in atlanta georgia who studied public health at emory university how are they going to make sure that people work out where they are six feet apart from each other at all times are they going to only let a lot of health and safety concerns and then locker rooms could be even a bigger issue mathew told cnn many of the gym executives that spoke to cnn said they have been busy planning how they will reopen and trying to do so carefully the accelerated timeline in georgia they said means many are unlikely to be ready to reopen facilities there on friday a spokesperson for planet fitness told cnn there is no set date for reopening their clubs in georgia fitness will reopen some franchised georgia locations on may the company confirmed to cnn in a statement and some executives who spoke to cnn expressed some hesitance at a lack of federal guidance dictating what measures they should follow when they reopen adam zeitsiff the ceo of gold s gym said that even in mongolia where gold s gym also operates the government has mandated distances between members a quota capacity for gyms and guidelines about testing employees there still has nt as to how we are going to reopen zeitsiff said every gym executive cnn spoke with said they had been working to develop companywide standards for cleaning and social distancing measures to keep members safe when they do reopen zeitsiff said that during phase one employees will be asked to wear a mask and gloves and people will be assigned to monitor who is using what machine going in and cleaning after members clean themselves they also plan to temperature check employees other gym fitness said they plan to use their company app to check people into their clubs with less contact between members and employees including eliminating touchscreen checkin machines hour fitness said they plan to open their gyms in minute sessions through the day followed by a minute closed gym cleaning period according to a statement they provided to cnn jim rowley ceo of crunch global said part of their procedures when reopening will be to use the gym app in order to limit class sizes for are also considering using it to check members in since closing crunch gyms rowley says his staff has been working on a page manual on their procedures for reopening the franchise is investing in special cleaning methods and hiring more staff to handle the increased cleaning demand we are spending and this is the tough part rowley said we do nt have any revenue but we are having to spend money to reopen on labor hiring new staff members buying products that are more expensive thinking about safety anthony geisler ceo and founder of xponential fitness which manages eight boutique fitness chains including the popular row house pure barre and club pilates said he believes boutique fitness studios are safer to reopen than big gym franchises because they are often smaller spaces and that it will be easier to track people taking classes if someone were to become sick there s a massive difference between a gym like a big box geisler told cnn mathew said gyms with large numbers of people coming in and out of the building is likely going to be a huge health hazard you can imagine in a gym setting if you just traced people from weight to weight if one person is infected he or she can infect three or four people around them and then the chain begins mathew said correction and update this story has been corrected to accurately state harvey spevak stake in the equinox group it also has been updated to include

fourth grade i feel as though he is at an age where it s appropriate to start introducing more mature topics or at least signaling our openness as parents to his questions about those topics i m thinking about anything from puberty sex and substances to peer pressure race and violence have a great relationship otherwise my son completely closes up when either my husband or i try to initiate conversations about these topics for example he told us recently that the gym teachers at school gave kids the puberty talk when i gently ask followup questions how do you feel about that or are the kids on the bus talking about sex he gets uncomfortable clams up and changes the subject last night we watched a the topic of racial discrimination i casually tried to use that as a springboard to start a conversation and he shut down he is an advanced and voracious reader and i know he s read books that include mature themes involving sex race or violence but when i ask him if he has questions or about what he learns and takes away from what he reads he s not interested in discussing it i have started resorting to saying anytime talk about something please come talk to dad or me i ve gotten to the point that i ve even bribed him by withholding something he wants like a dessert or screen time until he tells me say one thing his friends are saying about sex or one question he has about it this topic in particular is an important one to me as i want him to grow up in a sexpositive household and to understand the meaning of consent was raised as he gets older i imagine that he ll be exposed to more quite likely biased or inaccurate information from peers i don t want to alienate him by being too pushy but i m concerned that if he doesn t open up we won t have the opportunity to correct misinformation or educate him he is not especially introspective so i can t tell whether he genuinely doesn t have questions or if he talk about it i think it s a bit of both i guess i m wondering in what ways we should continue to attempt these conversations as he gets older do you have any suggestions on how to get him to open up open your heart to me i am sure you know this but you need to back way way off the bribing is not in fact bribing it s actually punishing him don information in their own time and in their own way and it sounds like he s a reader and a quiet thinker buy him good books about the things you are so desperate to talk to him about he knows you re there if he has questions oh boy does he ever and he s only i think you re trying to aggressively push the envelope on a lot of these issues i felt overwhelmed just reading your t feel like his parents are emotionally dependent on him to have the conversations you wish you d had when you were growing up you can have a sexpositive household without needing him to talk about it your job is to display daily through your actions and words the values you hold dear let the young lad be maybe he ll come to you maybe he ll work it out on his own a lot of parents find that kids when they don t have to make eye contact in the process he may also be more comfortable coming to his father with a lot of this so make sure your husband is also signaling his availability but not his desperation to have the big talks just take a breath for now i m not sure what to do about a year ago i lost my pregnancy at weeks it was devastating for both my husband and me where we would like to start trying again we both still want to have children however i did have some infertility issues and last time it took a little over two years to get pregnant and now i just can t seem to bring myself to talk to my doctor about this i feel embarrassed to even admit that i want to get pregnant again when it didn t work out the first time we did all the genetic testing available to make sure defective gene and everything came back negative it was just a fluke but what should i do just wait and hope that nature will take its course and i eventually get pregnant again or should i suck it up and seek help and has anyone else felt embarrassed talking about infertility or is it simply intensifying our loss i m so sorry for your loss twentythree weeks is an agonizing time to lose a muchwanted pregnancy and there really aren t any good s an exact replica of a figment of my imagination which is a very sad and deeply profound account of a similar experience and will at the very least make you feel less alone it does very little good to tell people experiencing infertility or the horrific aftermath of a stillbirth don t feel embarrassed don t feel like this is your fault because your feelings are your feelings and attempting to replace them with more productive feelings is just going re failing at something else talk to your doctor and consider asking for a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist if nature taking its course doesn t pan out explore your options seek support from one of the many online groups and message boards from people who have been through what you have been through reddit s rinfertility subreddit is very good be honest with your partner be kind to yourself if you missed sunday s care discuss this column in the slate parenting facebook group my yearold son has been pretty responsible for his whole life he always gets his homework done and turned in on time rarely loses things and does his chores without being asked however he got his braces off about seven months ago and is already on his fourth retainer as far as i ve seen he s using his case but he has returned home from school twice holding a broken lost it we have given him punishments when he loses them and praise when he doesn t for a little while but we need a better solution we can t keep paying for new retainers in addition to having him go a week with no retainer while it s being made what should we do he s i know it feels like you re setting a stack of money on fire all that orthodontia down the drain honestly do not know what you can do that you are not doing sit him down write down how much money you have spent on his mouth to date tell him you are willing to get him exactly one more retainer and after that he s on his own when he s an adult he can decide if he wants to invest in his teeth or not he s had a lot of dental work already so i doubt that he major problems by all means have your dentist lecture him if you have not already tried that if he loses some or all of the cosmetic benefits from his braces well that s his choice my parents were never able to afford braces for us and for most people in the world braces are a luxury item you got him the damn braces so you have my permission to throw up your hands and let him deal with the consequences of losing anxiety is too much dan kois jamilah lemieux and elizabeth newcamp host this week s episode of slate s parenting podcast mom and dad are fighting my husband works at a company with offices all over the country and has a highup job his company moves him around up to twice a year he insists we all come with him on every move which i m not against since he is close with our kids and it wouldn t be else for long stretches of time however my oldest kid a seventh grader has been to different schools since kindergarten and my first grader who is on her third school since kindergarten has been so affected by the moves that she can barely read the fourth grader isn t doing so well either he still can t read very well because of a weak early elementary foundation and has not mastered multiplication tables yet they also rarely have best of all of the moves we still have a toddler and we are planning on another baby when the toddler s in kindergarten or first grade but what can i do to negate the effect of all of these moves on my children s education and social life i am going to completely ignore the current news cycle and treat this like i would if you sent it last year this is absolutely ridiculous you can not do this it is having a terrible a partnership military families do not move with this kind of frequency and also receive far more practical support with the ensuing transitions while you are having to make everything up on the fly you need to sit your husband down and tell him what you ve just told me and that you need to have a permanent home for your family he may have to change jobs he may have to be a parttime dad but he can not put this burden on him like ducks the last thing i want is to tell anyone to shake up their employment situation right now but you can say hey we are simply unable to keep this up we ve done all the moving we can do where do we go from here this may not be a fun conversation but it is checks watch long overdue i am an only child to a mother who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness put her in some kind of outofhome care but we can t afford it the most we can manage is inhome health care essentially hospice which is covered by her insurance we have two kids ages and and we worry about the impact of this experience on them will they be traumatized or horrified by seeing the end of life will it put too much stress on the household in general   \n",

public health experts from revealing the true rate of infection in florida even today the truthful number of infections and deaths for the past year isn t known even desantis dismissed it as a blip which drew attacks from healthcare experts working in hospitals as the virus continued to spread desantis ignored it to such a degree that newspapers around the state began to beg him for help

various online retailers if you buy something through our links slate may earn an affiliate commission we update links when possible but note that deals can expire and all prices are subject to change all prices were up to date at the time of publication quarantine is putting a cramp in graduation parties sweet s and so many special occasions but don t forget father s day is coming true this year s might be a zoom checkin versus brunch with gifts aren t the point but it s pretty easy to send a thoughtful something while maintaining your social distance since my kids aren t in school at the moment they don t have teachers prodding them to remember to make father s day cards and since my family has two dads in it we re not going to end up with gifts that were stealthily chosen by a spouse if i were going to treat myself though here for the dad who s coping by cooking the best gift for a home cook isn t an appliance or something fancy most amateurs are quite specific about their dream stand mixers or chef s knives anyway but you can t go wrong with a kitchen basic i prepare percent of my family s meals yet i still skimp on the little practical tools that would make that labor so much easier why i have no idea for more than a decade i recently replaced it and the new one makes me so happy we only had one colander for ages not long ago i bought three more and that makes a lot more sense also if someone gave me a bucket of maldon i would weep with joy yet somehow i would never buy this for myself for the dad who s honing a new skill some people are keeping journals others are trying their hand at portraiture others are just learning to teach their fifth grader math no matter what dad s up to a pencil will help i have always wanted personalized pencils because why not and this pencil sharpener is one of the mostused tools in my new homeslashschool for the dad who misses a civilized evening out many of us are panicdrinking a pm glass of wine but one of the particular pleasures i miss is going to an elegant bar and having someone else fix me heavy bowl full of something salty it s a simple pleasure but one i relish it s almost worth recreating at home with a bottle of something specialoccasiony for the dad who s tired of screen time bingewatching is all well and good but there s nothing better than a book my friends at my local bookshop books are magic offer a great subscription service a brandnew highly anticipated book a monthyou choose whether dad prefers fiction or non the prose manage a gift subscription programthey tailor recommended titles to the profile you provide one of my favorite publishers new york review books has a monthly subscription program too if you ve got a dad whose taste runs from renata adler to patrick modiano the other oldfashioned pursuit i recommend backgammon it s so gentlemanly but great fun straightforward enough that you can teach a year old but complex enough to be competitive even intense a travel set is ideal because we can all use some fresh air for the dad who misses going to the museum it is absolutely not possible to replicate the experience of visiting a museum while at home but i m bummed i missed the donald judd show currently installed in a shuttered moma and i d happily take a quiet hour to pore over its catalog for me no visit to a museum is complete without an espresso in the cafe a homebrewed macchiato would help perfect the illusion no but still pretty nice for the dad who misses going to the movies there are streaming services aplentyone kind of dad might prefer a subscription to the criterion channel while another might like an upgrade to amazon prime which brings with it access to a vast library but both dads will enjoy candy in a movie theater box which by some magic simply tastes better for the dad with real flair there s not a lot of point in getting dressed up these pursuit an overthetop print upgrades baggu s handy reusable totes if we re all wearing our comfiest sneakers there s no reason we can t give them an instant upgrade with some colorful new laces and we re all washing our hands a lot moisturizing is key for the dad who s working out at home we re not going to the gym true but neither are we wasting two hours daily on a commute working out handful of gear to me the genius of a good headband is not its ability to regulate sweat but that it can double as a system for keeping earbuds where they belongthe simplest upgrade but one that really helps the exercise routine also a good mat changes everything   \n",

this days when the party appears to be lining up behind him when he appears strong energized and ready to take on president trump and his monster political and fundraising organization biden s cycle of good news in the wake of his massive south carolina victory began sunday night with former south bend mayor pete buttigieg s decision to leave the race by day s end monday biden had buttigieg s support along dallas from former rivals sen amy klobuchar dmn who ended her own presidential run monday and former texas rep beto o rourke klobuchar joked it was wonderful to be standing next to biden on stage like this instead of facing off in a debate amy won all the debates biden told the crowd later and i m sure glad i wasn t on stage debating you again amy the younger generation that tried to beat biden folks this is a team we need your help biden called to the crowd after klobuchar and o rourke had sung his praises optimism has reigned in biden s campaign as he launched from the south carolina victory a sense of direction that pushed past super tuesday states and into the delegaterich state of florida the winnowing of the field continues biden s recent resurgence but it also cuts into former new york city mayor mike bloomberg s case frontrunner campaign presented bloomberg with an opportunity to enter the race at the eleventh hour last year the billionaire may now be the last moderate rival biden has to box out in the fluid race as the day began some voters in florida remained undecided as they waited to make their voices heard biden s performance in south carolina largely swayed yearold bruce nathanson to the democrat s side that support is soft however and he s left room to back bloomberg support the guy who s going to get the most votes on the moderate side he said if it s a super blowout for bloomberg i probably would go bloomberg nathanson said of super tuesday in florida television advertising and the strength of bloomberg s massive campaign operation could loom large but biden s campaign appears to be betting that getting democrats like rep debbie wasserman schultz dfl off the sidelines will shore up the support he needs sen bernie sanders ivt progressive revolution speaking at an organizing event in broward county wasserman schultz echoed what has become biden supporters consistent message of late he knows you he s struggled he cares about health care and he knows about heartbreak the resilience of this man is striking wasserman schultz told a crowd monday morning it really is whether that will be enough to win out over a bloomberg barrage aimed at the same crowd case study in whether a national profile can contend with freewheeling campaign spending i don t know that the democratic party is one where you can just put a lot of ads out and spend a lot of money said yearold biden supporter jennifer martin a moderate biden supporter i don t think that s the message that democrats believe in the prospect of a contested convention remains and florida s delegate haul is a substantial store of support for the the state s march primary leslie sills a yearold executive chef and pastry chef already backs biden and voiced his anger at trump as he stood outside the biden campaign s monday morning event but bloomberg spending his wealth on the race didn t bother sills in the slightest if i had the money bloomberg has i d be going for president myself he said bloomberg will be in florida on super tuesday campaigning in see if his unique approach of ignoring the first four states in favor of a major super tuesday push is indeed the kind of standards breaking political move his campaign has trumpeted it to be his campaign touted its florida operation in a press release monday morning boasting that the former mayor s state campaign is stronger than ever no other campaign has a bigger footprint in florida bloomberg s florida state director scott kosanovich said in the release for months knocking thousands of doors weekly talking to voters about mike s record on climate change gun safety and health care floridians know mike is the best candidate to defeat donald trump even at the biden organizing event wasserman schultz spoke at on monday bloomberg continued to be an enticing option for some the hunger to beat trump is as ferocious as ever and discomfort over the frontrunner sanders from some in the moderate base of the party is evident amma said she s struggling to decide between biden and bloomberg the former mayor may have a better chance in florida s general election she said he was a republican and florida s a republican state she said other more enthusiastic biden supporters have already had enough of bloomberg in one case a volunteer mirrored an attack on the former new york city mayor that sen elizabeth warren dma used to raise her campaign s profile in the debate basically bloomberg is just a different trump ali giammarella a yearold biden volunteer said   \n",
