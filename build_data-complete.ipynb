       "      <td>Are the official death statistics for the novel coronavirus COVID-19 being manipulated to show a higher ‘ death count ’ than is actually the case ?\\nThis appears to be happening , as evidenced by new medical guidelines issued by United States Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) specifically for COVID-19 .\\nIt seems that arbitrary assumptions are being made which are feeding into the US government ’ s national statistics data bank .\\nIndeed , any person dying ‘ with ’ COVID-19 , or ‘ suspected symptoms of COVID-19 ’ concomitant with multiple long-term chronic medical conditions – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of death in the same way as a definitive diagnosis and determination of mortality of someone actually dying ‘ from ’ COVID-19 .\\nThe result of this institutional distortion in numbers may have led to a massive inflation of COVD-19 fatalities , which in turn , is being use to justify oppressive ‘ lockdown ’ policies and economic and social devastation across the United States of America , and the world .\\nWhen confronted on this very issue , Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any queries on the matter as conspiracy theories .\\n“ There is absolutely no evidence that that ’ s the case at all … .\\nI think it falls under the category of something that ’ s very unfortunate – these conspiracy theories that we hear about .\\nAny time we have a crisis of any sort there is always this popping up of conspiracy theories , ” stated Fauci just last week .\\nHowever , the evidence strongly suggests his is not a theory , but rather an inconvenient truth of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see her full video presentation below ) : “ At a time where telling the truth is considered a threat to the national security , we ’ re very blessed to have a pastor who tells us the truth .\\nWe are blessed beyond measure .\\n… ” “ The decision for unprecedented government-mandated lockdown has been based on the alleged death rate of COVID-19 .\\nIs this death rate based on truth ?\\n… ” “ Are the reported deaths from COVID-19 truly deaths from COVID-19 ?\\nTo address this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since death certificates are the basic source of information about mortality .\\n… ” “ History-changing decisions are being made due to these figures despite the fact that they are flat-out wrong based on data that is insufficient and often inaccurate .\\nPeople know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician coroner or medical examiner signing the death certificate .\\nHow do I know this ?\\nI ’ ve been filling out death certificates for over 30 years .\\nMore often than we want to admit , we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death when we fill out death certificates .\\n… ” “ Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form then that listed cause of death , whatever we list , is entered into a vital records databank to use for statistical analysis which then gives out inaccurate numbers as you can imagine .\\nThose inaccurate numbers are then accepted as factual information even though much of it is false .\\nSo even before we heard of COVID-19 , death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there ’ s the additional data skewer that there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death.\\n” “ The Center for Disease Control , updated from yesterday April 4th , still states that “ mortality ” data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 .\\n… The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same , they call it death by COVID-19 .\\nThey automatically overestimate the real death numbers by their own admission .\\n… ” “ We need to understand how the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing physicians to fill out death certificates related to COVID-19 .\\nBrace yourselves , and please pay attention and let what I ’ m about to tell you sink in .\\nThe assumption of COVID-19 death could be made even without testing .\\nBased on assumption alone , the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty .\\nThe March 24 , 2020 NVSS memo states “ Stephen Schwartz , national director of the division of vital statistics , says an answer to the question as stated in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test ?\\n” Check out his answer , “ If a patient is positive for COVID-19 and dies from another cause such as pneumococcal sepsis , it may be considered accurate to say that person died with COVID-19 not from COVID-19 .\\nYet the CDC guideline lists this case as one more COVID-19 death and they go to the next questionable death , they label that as COVID-19 and it goes on and on .\\nYou could see how these statistics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy to add false numbers to the official database .\\nThose false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC as of their memo yesterday , April 4th .\\n… ” “ The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think .\\nHow many people actually died from COVID-19 is anyone ’ s guess .\\n… ” “ Based on inaccurate , incomplete data , people are being terrorized by fear-mongers into relinquishing freedoms.\\n” Watch this full video presentation from Dr. Annie Bukacek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many thanks to

Government ) with two branches ( Democrats and Republicans ) .\\nWhile Democrats talk a big game about being America ’ s ‘ green ’ guardians of the environment , in the end both parties will bow to transnational corporations if the price is right .\\nA perfect example is the highly dirty and loss-leading unconventional oil and gas drilling practice of hydraulic fracturing , commonly known as fracking .\\nIt seems that California ’ s governor Gavin Newson has just given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells located in some of the state ’ s most beautiful areas .\\nWith the state under shutdown orders because of COVID-19 , the state ’ s Democratic governor has seized the opportunity to push through even more permits for the highly controversial energy extraction process .\\nGov .\\nGavin Newsom , left , touring the Chevron oilfield in McKittrick , CA ( Photo Credit : Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via AP , Pool ) California regulators on Friday issued fracking permits for the first time in nine months , saying federal scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aera Energy for oil well stimulation in Kern County .\\nAnother 282 applications remain on hold pending individual review , until a comprehensive audit of the state ’ s drill permitting practices is completed .\\n“ Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory experts are continuing evaluation on a permit-by-permit basis and conducting a rigorous technical review to verify geological claims made by well operators in the application process , ” said Teresa Schilling , spokeswoman for the California Geologic Energy Management division , or CalGEM .\\n“ Permit-by-permit review will continue until the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” ( … ) In November , after reports by The Desert Sun about illegal oil spills across the state , and empty “ dummy ” project folders for risky cyclic steam permits issued without required upfront approvals , Newsom announced a moratorium on all new fracking and cyclic steam permits .\\nWhile environmentalists and consumer advocates were delighted with the halt , Newsom and other state officials faced immediate , fierce backlash from oil executives and employees , and from Kern County officials , where most of the state ’ s petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southern part of the Central Valley .\\nOn Friday , new Oil and Gas Supervisor Uduak-Joe Ntuk notified Aera Energy that he had signed off on two dozen permits for fracking wells in its North and South Belridge oil field operations .\\nHe did so after Aera provided additional , detailed field descriptions and other technical data and guarantees requested by the Lawrence Livermore reviewers .\\nThe federal lab also evaluated CalGEM ’ s engineering and geologic analyses .\\n( … ) But opponents were not happy that the state has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a risky drilling technique , particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic .\\n“ With the entire state shut down and kids out of school , what purpose could approving these fracking permits have now , other than to do a solid for the oil industry when no one is watching ?\\nThis is like a Pearl Harbor attack for the environment , ” said Jamie Court , executive director of Consumer Watchdog , which unearthed the data about conflicts of interest among senior oil regulators .\\n“ As if California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fracking is now back .\\n… What pebble-minded bureaucrat decided that as we hunker

case ?\\nThis appears to be happening , as evidenced by new medical guidelines issued by United States Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) specifically for COVID-19 .\\nIt seems that arbitrary assumptions are being made which are feeding into the US government ’ s national statistics data bank .\\nIndeed , any person dying ‘ with ’ COVID-19 , or ‘ suspected symptoms of COVID-19 ’ concomitant with multiple long-term chronic medical conditions – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of death in the same way as a definitive diagnosis and determination of mortality of someone actually dying ‘ from ’ COVID-19 .\\nThe result of this institutional distortion in numbers may have led to a massive inflation of COVD-19 fatalities , which in turn , is being use to justify oppressive ‘ lockdown ’ policies and economic and social devastation across the United States of America , and the world .\\nWhen confronted on this very issue , Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any queries on the matter as conspiracy theories .\\n“ There is absolutely no evidence that that ’ s the case at all … .\\nI think it falls under the category of something that ’ s very unfortunate – these conspiracy theories that we hear about .\\nAny time we have a crisis of any sort there is always this popping up of conspiracy theories , ” stated Fauci just last week .\\nHowever , the evidence strongly suggests his is not a theory , but rather an inconvenient truth of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see her full video presentation below ) : “ At a time where telling the truth is considered a threat to the national security , we ’ re very blessed to have a pastor who tells us the truth .\\nWe are blessed beyond measure .\\n… ” “ The decision for unprecedented government-mandated lockdown has been based on the alleged death rate of COVID-19 .\\nIs this death rate based on truth ?\\n… ” “ Are the reported deaths from COVID-19 truly deaths from COVID-19 ?\\nTo address this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since death certificates are the basic source of information about mortality .\\n… ” “ History-changing decisions are being made due to these figures despite the fact that they are flat-out wrong based on data that is insufficient and often inaccurate .\\nPeople know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician coroner or medical examiner signing the death certificate .\\nHow do I know this ?\\nI ’ ve been filling out death certificates for over 30 years .\\nMore often than we want to admit , we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death when we fill out death certificates .\\n… ” “ Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form then that listed cause of death , whatever we list , is entered into a vital records databank to use for statistical analysis which then gives out inaccurate numbers as you can imagine .\\nThose inaccurate numbers are then accepted as factual information even though much of it is false .\\nSo even before we heard of COVID-19 , death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there ’ s the additional data skewer that there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death.\\n” “ The Center for Disease Control , updated from yesterday April 4th , still states that “ mortality ” data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 .\\n… The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same , they call it death by COVID-19 .\\nThey automatically overestimate the real death numbers by their own admission .\\n… ” “ We need to understand how the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing physicians to fill out death certificates related to COVID-19 .\\nBrace yourselves , and please pay attention and let what I ’ m about to tell you sink in .\\nThe assumption of COVID-19 death could be made even without testing .\\nBased on assumption alone , the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty .\\nThe March 24 , 2020 NVSS memo states “ Stephen Schwartz , national director of the division of vital statistics , says an answer to the question as stated in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test ?\\n” Check out his answer , “ If a patient is positive for COVID-19 and dies from another cause such as pneumococcal sepsis , it may be considered accurate to say that person died with COVID-19 not from COVID-19 .\\nYet the CDC guideline lists this case as one more COVID-19 death and they go to the next questionable death , they label that as COVID-19 and it goes on and on .\\nYou could see how these statistics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy to add false numbers to the official database .\\nThose false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC as of their memo yesterday , April 4th .\\n… ” “ The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think .\\nHow many people actually died from COVID-19 is anyone ’ s guess .\\n… ” “ Based on inaccurate , incomplete data , people are being terrorized by fear-mongers into relinquishing freedoms.\\n” Watch this full video presentation from

       "      <td>Are the official death statistics for the novel coronavirus COVID-19 being manipulated to show a higher ‘ death count ’ than is actually the case ?\\nThis appears to be happening , as evidenced by new medical guidelines issued by United States Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) specifically for COVID-19 .\\nIt seems that arbitrary assumptions are being made which are feeding into the US government ’ s national statistics data bank .\\nIndeed , any person dying ‘ with ’ COVID-19 , or ‘ suspected symptoms of COVID-19 ’ concomitant with multiple long-term chronic medical conditions – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of death in the same way as a definitive diagnosis and determination of mortality of someone actually dying ‘ from ’ COVID-19 .\\nThe result of this institutional distortion in numbers may have led to a massive inflation of COVD-19 fatalities , which in turn , is being use to justify oppressive ‘ lockdown ’ policies and economic and social devastation across the United States of America , and the world .\\nWhen confronted on this very issue , Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any queries on the matter as conspiracy theories .\\n“ There is absolutely no evidence that that ’ s the case at all … .\\nI think it falls under the category of something that ’ s very unfortunate – these conspiracy theories that we hear about .\\nAny time we have a crisis of any sort there is always this popping up of conspiracy theories , ” stated Fauci just last week .\\nHowever , the evidence strongly suggests his is not a theory , but rather an inconvenient truth of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see her full video presentation below ) : “ At a time where telling the truth is considered a threat to the national security , we ’ re very blessed to have a pastor who tells us the truth .\\nWe are blessed beyond measure .\\n… ” “ The decision for unprecedented government-mandated lockdown has been based on the alleged death rate of COVID-19 .\\nIs this death rate based on truth ?\\n… ” “ Are the reported deaths from COVID-19 truly deaths from COVID-19 ?\\nTo address this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since death certificates are the basic source of information about mortality .\\n… ” “ History-changing decisions are being made due to these figures despite the fact that they are flat-out wrong based on data that is insufficient and often inaccurate .\\nPeople know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician coroner or medical examiner signing the death certificate .\\nHow do I know this ?\\nI ’ ve been filling out death certificates for over 30 years .\\nMore often than we want to admit , we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death when we fill out death certificates .\\n… ” “ Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form then that listed cause of death , whatever we list , is entered into a vital records databank to use for statistical analysis which then gives out inaccurate numbers as you can imagine .\\nThose inaccurate numbers are then accepted as factual information even though much of it is false .\\nSo even before we heard of COVID-19 , death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there ’ s the additional data skewer that there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death.\\n” “ The Center for Disease Control , updated from yesterday April 4th , still states that “ mortality ” data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 .\\n… The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same , they call it death by COVID-19 .\\nThey automatically overestimate the real death numbers by their own admission .\\n… ” “ We need to understand how the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing physicians to fill out death certificates related to COVID-19 .\\nBrace yourselves , and please pay attention and let what I ’ m about to tell you sink in .\\nThe assumption of COVID-19 death could be made even without testing .\\nBased on assumption alone , the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty .\\nThe March 24 , 2020 NVSS memo states “ Stephen Schwartz , national director of the division of vital statistics , says an answer to the question as stated in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test ?\\n” Check out his answer , “ If a patient is positive for COVID-19 and dies from another cause such as pneumococcal sepsis , it may be considered accurate to say that person died with COVID-19 not from COVID-19 .\\nYet the CDC guideline lists this case as one more COVID-19 death and they go to the next questionable death , they label that as COVID-19 and it goes on and on .\\nYou could see how these statistics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy to add false numbers to the official database .\\nThose false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC as of their memo yesterday , April 4th .\\n… ” “ The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think .\\nHow many people actually died from COVID-19 is anyone ’ s guess .\\n… ” “ Based on inaccurate , incomplete data , people are being terrorized by fear-mongers into relinquishing freedoms.\\n” Watch this full video presentation from Dr. Annie Bukacek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many thanks to

Government ) with two branches ( Democrats and Republicans ) .\\nWhile Democrats talk a big game about being America ’ s ‘ green ’ guardians of the environment , in the end both parties will bow to transnational corporations if the price is right .\\nA perfect example is the highly dirty and loss-leading unconventional oil and gas drilling practice of hydraulic fracturing , commonly known as fracking .\\nIt seems that California ’ s governor Gavin Newson has just given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells located in some of the state ’ s most beautiful areas .\\nWith the state under shutdown orders because of COVID-19 , the state ’ s Democratic governor has seized the opportunity to push through even more permits for the highly controversial energy extraction process .\\nGov .\\nGavin Newsom , left , touring the Chevron oilfield in McKittrick , CA ( Photo Credit : Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via AP , Pool ) California regulators on Friday issued fracking permits for the first time in nine months , saying federal scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aera Energy for oil well stimulation in Kern County .\\nAnother 282 applications remain on hold pending individual review , until a comprehensive audit of the state ’ s drill permitting practices is completed .\\n“ Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory experts are continuing evaluation on a permit-by-permit basis and conducting a rigorous technical review to verify geological claims made by well operators in the application process , ” said Teresa Schilling , spokeswoman for the California Geologic Energy Management division , or CalGEM .\\n“ Permit-by-permit review will continue until the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” ( … ) In November , after reports by The Desert Sun about illegal oil spills across the state , and empty “ dummy ” project folders for risky cyclic steam permits issued without required upfront approvals , Newsom announced a moratorium on all new fracking and cyclic steam permits .\\nWhile environmentalists and consumer advocates were delighted with the halt , Newsom and other state officials faced immediate , fierce backlash from oil executives and employees , and from Kern County officials , where most of the state ’ s petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southern part of the Central Valley .\\nOn Friday , new Oil and Gas Supervisor Uduak-Joe Ntuk notified Aera Energy that he had signed off on two dozen permits for fracking wells in its North and South Belridge oil field operations .\\nHe did so after Aera provided additional , detailed field descriptions and other technical data and guarantees requested by the Lawrence Livermore reviewers .\\nThe federal lab also evaluated CalGEM ’ s engineering and geologic analyses .\\n( … ) But opponents were not happy that the state has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a risky drilling technique , particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic .\\n“ With the entire state shut down and kids out of school , what purpose could approving these fracking permits have now , other than to do a solid for the oil industry when no one is watching ?\\nThis is like a Pearl Harbor attack for the environment , ” said Jamie Court , executive director of Consumer Watchdog , which unearthed the data about conflicts of interest among senior oil regulators .\\n“ As if California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fracking is now back .\\n… What pebble-minded bureaucrat decided that as we hunker in our homes trying to avoid a plague that it was time to bring fracking back ?\\n”   \n",

                                                        Are the official death statistics for the novel coronavirus COVID-19 being manipulated to show a higher ‘ death count ’ than is actually the case ?\\nThis appears to be happening , as evidenced by new medical guidelines issued by United States Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) specifically for COVID-19 .\\nIt seems that arbitrary assumptions are being made which are feeding into the US government ’ s national statistics data bank .\\nIndeed , any person dying ‘ with ’ COVID-19 , or ‘ suspected symptoms of COVID-19 ’ concomitant with multiple long-term chronic medical conditions – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of death in the same way as a definitive diagnosis and determination of mortality of someone actually dying ‘ from ’ COVID-19 .\\nThe result of this institutional distortion in numbers may have led to a massive inflation of COVD-19 fatalities , which in turn , is being use to justify oppressive ‘ lockdown ’ policies and economic and social devastation across the United States of America , and the world .\\nWhen confronted on this very issue , Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any queries on the matter as conspiracy theories .\\n“ There is absolutely no evidence that that ’ s the case at all … .\\nI think it falls under the category of something that ’ s very unfortunate – these conspiracy theories that we hear about .\\nAny time we have a crisis of any sort there is always this popping up of conspiracy theories , ” stated Fauci just last week .\\nHowever , the evidence strongly suggests his is not a theory , but rather an inconvenient truth of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see her full video presentation below ) : “ At a time where telling the truth is considered a threat to the national security , we ’ re very blessed to have a pastor who tells us the truth .\\nWe are blessed beyond measure .\\n… ” “ The decision for unprecedented government-mandated lockdown has been based on the alleged death rate of COVID-19 .\\nIs this death rate based on truth ?\\n… ” “ Are the reported deaths from COVID-19 truly deaths from COVID-19 ?\\nTo address this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since death certificates are the basic source of information about mortality .\\n… ” “ History-changing decisions are being made due to these figures despite the fact that they are flat-out wrong based on data that is insufficient and often inaccurate .\\nPeople know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician coroner or medical examiner signing the death certificate .\\nHow do I know this ?\\nI ’ ve been filling out death certificates for over 30 years .\\nMore often than we want to admit , we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death when we fill out death certificates .\\n… ” “ Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form then that listed cause of death , whatever we list , is entered into a vital records databank to use for statistical analysis which then gives out inaccurate numbers as you can imagine .\\nThose inaccurate numbers are then accepted as factual information even though much of it is false .\\nSo even before we heard of COVID-19 , death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there ’ s the additional data skewer that there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death.\\n” “ The Center for Disease Control , updated from yesterday April 4th , still states that “ mortality ” data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 .\\n… The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same , they call it death by COVID-19 .\\nThey automatically overestimate the real death numbers by their own admission .\\n… ” “ We need to understand how the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing physicians to fill out death certificates related to COVID-19 .\\nBrace yourselves , and please pay attention and let what I ’ m about to tell you sink in .\\nThe assumption of COVID-19 death could be made even without testing .\\nBased on assumption alone , the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty .\\nThe March 24 , 2020 NVSS memo states “ Stephen Schwartz , national director of the division of vital statistics , says an answer to the question as stated in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test ?\\n” Check out his answer , “ If a patient is positive for COVID-19 and dies from another cause such as pneumococcal sepsis , it may be considered accurate to say that person died with COVID-19 not from COVID-19 .\\nYet the CDC guideline lists this case as one more COVID-19 death and they go to the next questionable death , they label that as COVID-19 and it goes on and on .\\nYou could see how these statistics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy to add false numbers to the official database .\\nThose false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC as of their memo yesterday , April 4th .\\n… ” “ The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think .\\nHow many people actually died from COVID-19 is anyone ’ s guess .\\n… ” “ Based on inaccurate , incomplete data , people are being terrorized by fear-mongers into relinquishing freedoms.\\n” Watch this full video presentation from

       "      <td>Are the official death statistics for the novel coronavirus COVID-19 being manipulated to show a higher ‘ death count ’ than is actually the case ?\\nThis appears to be happening , as evidenced by new medical guidelines issued by United States Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) specifically for COVID-19 .\\nIt seems that arbitrary assumptions are being made which are feeding into the US government ’ s national statistics data bank .\\nIndeed , any person dying ‘ with ’ COVID-19 , or ‘ suspected symptoms of COVID-19 ’ concomitant with multiple long-term chronic medical conditions – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of death in the same way as a definitive diagnosis and determination of mortality of someone actually dying ‘ from ’ COVID-19 .\\nThe result of this institutional distortion in numbers may have led to a massive inflation of COVD-19 fatalities , which in turn , is being use to justify oppressive ‘ lockdown ’ policies and economic and social devastation across the United States of America , and the world .\\nWhen confronted on this very issue , Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any queries on the matter as conspiracy theories .\\n“ There is absolutely no evidence that that ’ s the case at all … .\\nI think it falls under the category of something that ’ s very unfortunate – these conspiracy theories that we hear about .\\nAny time we have a crisis of any sort there is always this popping up of conspiracy theories , ” stated Fauci just last week .\\nHowever , the evidence strongly suggests his is not a theory , but rather an inconvenient truth of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see her full video presentation below ) : “ At a time where telling the truth is considered a threat to the national security , we ’ re very blessed to have a pastor who tells us the truth .\\nWe are blessed beyond measure .\\n… ” “ The decision for unprecedented government-mandated lockdown has been based on the alleged death rate of COVID-19 .\\nIs this death rate based on truth ?\\n… ” “ Are the reported deaths from COVID-19 truly deaths from COVID-19 ?\\nTo address this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since death certificates are the basic source of information about mortality .\\n… ” “ History-changing decisions are being made due to these figures despite the fact that they are flat-out wrong based on data that is insufficient and often inaccurate .\\nPeople know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician coroner or medical examiner signing the death certificate .\\nHow do I know this ?\\nI ’ ve been filling out death certificates for over 30 years .\\nMore often than we want to admit , we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death when we fill out death certificates .\\n… ” “ Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form then that listed cause of death , whatever we list , is entered into a vital records databank to use for statistical analysis which then gives out inaccurate numbers as you can imagine .\\nThose inaccurate numbers are then accepted as factual information even though much of it is false .\\nSo even before we heard of COVID-19 , death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there ’ s the additional data skewer that there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death.\\n” “ The Center for Disease Control , updated from yesterday April 4th , still states that “ mortality ” data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 .\\n… The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same , they call it death by COVID-19 .\\nThey automatically overestimate the real death numbers by their own admission .\\n… ” “ We need to understand how the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing physicians to fill out death certificates related to COVID-19 .\\nBrace yourselves , and please pay attention and let what I ’ m about to tell you sink in .\\nThe assumption of COVID-19 death could be made even without testing .\\nBased on assumption alone , the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty .\\nThe March 24 , 2020 NVSS memo states “ Stephen Schwartz , national director of the division of vital statistics , says an answer to the question as stated in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test ?\\n” Check out his answer , “ If a patient is positive for COVID-19 and dies from another cause such as pneumococcal sepsis , it may be considered accurate to say that person died with COVID-19 not from COVID-19 .\\nYet the CDC guideline lists this case as one more COVID-19 death and they go to the next questionable death , they label that as COVID-19 and it goes on and on .\\nYou could see how these statistics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy to add false numbers to the official database .\\nThose false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC as of their memo yesterday , April 4th .\\n… ” “ The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think .\\nHow many people actually died from COVID-19 is anyone ’ s guess .\\n… ” “ Based on inaccurate , incomplete data , people are being terrorized by fear-mongers into relinquishing freedoms.\\n” Watch this full video presentation from Dr. Annie Bukacek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many thanks to

Government ) with two branches ( Democrats and Republicans ) .\\nWhile Democrats talk a big game about being America ’ s ‘ green ’ guardians of the environment , in the end both parties will bow to transnational corporations if the price is right .\\nA perfect example is the highly dirty and loss-leading unconventional oil and gas drilling practice of hydraulic fracturing , commonly known as fracking .\\nIt seems that California ’ s governor Gavin Newson has just given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells located in some of the state ’ s most beautiful areas .\\nWith the state under shutdown orders because of COVID-19 , the state ’ s Democratic governor has seized the opportunity to push through even more permits for the highly controversial energy extraction process .\\nGov .\\nGavin Newsom , left , touring the Chevron oilfield in McKittrick , CA ( Photo Credit : Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via AP , Pool ) California regulators on Friday issued fracking permits for the first time in nine months , saying federal scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aera Energy for oil well stimulation in Kern County .\\nAnother 282 applications remain on hold pending individual review , until a comprehensive audit of the state ’ s drill permitting practices is completed .\\n“ Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory experts are continuing evaluation on a permit-by-permit basis and conducting a rigorous technical review to verify geological claims made by well operators in the application process , ” said Teresa Schilling , spokeswoman for the California Geologic Energy Management division , or CalGEM .\\n“ Permit-by-permit review will continue until the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” ( … ) In November , after reports by The Desert Sun about illegal oil spills across the state , and empty “ dummy ” project folders for risky cyclic steam permits issued without required upfront approvals , Newsom announced a moratorium on all new fracking and cyclic steam permits .\\nWhile environmentalists and consumer advocates were delighted with the halt , Newsom and other state officials faced immediate , fierce backlash from oil executives and employees , and from Kern County officials , where most of the state ’ s petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southern part of the Central Valley .\\nOn Friday , new Oil and Gas Supervisor Uduak-Joe Ntuk notified Aera Energy that he had signed off on two dozen permits for fracking wells in its North and South Belridge oil field operations .\\nHe did so after Aera provided additional , detailed field descriptions and other technical data and guarantees requested by the Lawrence Livermore reviewers .\\nThe federal lab also evaluated CalGEM ’ s engineering and geologic analyses .\\n( … ) But opponents were not happy that the state has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a risky drilling technique , particularly in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic .\\n“ With the entire state shut down and kids out of school , what purpose could approving these fracking permits have now , other than to do a solid for the oil industry when no one is watching ?\\nThis is like a Pearl Harbor attack for the environment , ” said Jamie Court , executive director of Consumer Watchdog , which unearthed the data about conflicts of interest among senior oil regulators .\\n“ As if California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fracking is now back .\\n… What pebble-minded bureaucrat decided that as we hunker in our homes trying to avoid a plague that it was time to bring fracking back ?\\n”   \n",

                                                        Are the official death statistics for the novel coronavirus COVID-19 being manipulated to show a higher ‘ death count ’ than is actually the case ?\\nThis appears to be happening , as evidenced by new medical guidelines issued by United States Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) specifically for COVID-19 .\\nIt seems that arbitrary assumptions are being made which are feeding into the US government ’ s national statistics data bank .\\nIndeed , any person dying ‘ with ’ COVID-19 , or ‘ suspected symptoms of COVID-19 ’ concomitant with multiple long-term chronic medical conditions – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of death in the same way as a definitive diagnosis and determination of mortality of someone actually dying ‘ from ’ COVID-19 .\\nThe result of this institutional distortion in numbers may have led to a massive inflation of COVD-19 fatalities , which in turn , is being use to justify oppressive ‘ lockdown ’ policies and economic and social devastation across the United States of America , and the world .\\nWhen confronted on this very issue , Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any queries on the matter as conspiracy theories .\\n“ There is absolutely no evidence that that ’ s the case at all … .\\nI think it falls under the category of something that ’ s very unfortunate – these conspiracy theories that we hear about .\\nAny time we have a crisis of any sort there is always this popping up of conspiracy theories , ” stated Fauci just last week .\\nHowever , the evidence strongly suggests his is not a theory , but rather an inconvenient truth of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see her full video presentation below ) : “ At a time where telling the truth is considered a threat to the national security , we ’ re very blessed to have a pastor who tells us the truth .\\nWe are blessed beyond measure .\\n… ” “ The decision for unprecedented government-mandated lockdown has been based on the alleged death rate of COVID-19 .\\nIs this death rate based on truth ?\\n… ” “ Are the reported deaths from COVID-19 truly deaths from COVID-19 ?\\nTo address this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since death certificates are the basic source of information about mortality .\\n… ” “ History-changing decisions are being made due to these figures despite the fact that they are flat-out wrong based on data that is insufficient and often inaccurate .\\nPeople know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician coroner or medical examiner signing the death certificate .\\nHow do I know this ?\\nI ’ ve been filling out death certificates for over 30 years .\\nMore often than we want to admit , we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death when we fill out death certificates .\\n… ” “ Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form then that listed cause of death , whatever we list , is entered into a vital records databank to use for statistical analysis which then gives out inaccurate numbers as you can imagine .\\nThose inaccurate numbers are then accepted as factual information even though much of it is false .\\nSo even before we heard of COVID-19 , death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there ’ s the additional data skewer that there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death.\\n” “ The Center for Disease Control , updated from yesterday April 4th , still states that “ mortality ” data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 .\\n… The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same , they call it death by COVID-19 .\\nThey automatically overestimate the real death numbers by their own admission .\\n… ” “ We need to understand how the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing physicians to fill out death certificates related to COVID-19 .\\nBrace yourselves , and please pay attention and let what I ’ m about to tell you sink in .\\nThe assumption of COVID-19 death could be made even without testing .\\nBased on assumption alone , the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty .\\nThe March 24 , 2020 NVSS memo states “ Stephen Schwartz , national director of the division of vital statistics , says an answer to the question as stated in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test ?\\n” Check out his answer , “ If a patient is positive for COVID-19 and dies from another cause such as pneumococcal sepsis , it may be considered accurate to say that person died with COVID-19 not from COVID-19 .\\nYet the CDC guideline lists this case as one more COVID-19 death and they go to the next questionable death , they label that as COVID-19 and it goes on and on .\\nYou could see how these statistics have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so easy to add false numbers to the official database .\\nThose false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC as of their memo yesterday , April 4th .\\n… ” “ The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think .\\nHow many people actually died from COVID-19 is anyone ’ s guess .\\n… ” “ Based on inaccurate , incomplete data , people are being terrorized by fear-mongers into relinquishing freedoms.\\n” Watch this full video presentation from

''\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of general obligation debt and still is three notches below investment grade .\\nBut the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic could have a longer-term impact on the city ’ s credit .\\n“ Detroit ’ s revenue structure is significantly exposed to economic downturns because gambling and income taxes comprise two of the two largest revenue sources , ” David Levett , Moody ’ s lead analyst for Detroit , said last week .\\n“ That said , the city ’ s fiscal 2019 audit , which was released in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an improved capacity to respond to stresses .\\n”</td>\n",

       "      <td>cnn president donald trump s administration is taking on the characteristics of a tottering regime with its loyalty tests destabilizing attacks on the military chain of command a deepening bunker mentality and increasingly delusional claims of political victory in response a visibly confident presidentelect joe biden is going out of his way to project calm amid the deepening chaos even as trump and senior republicans still refuse to acknowledge the president s defeat in a stunning break with america s democratic traditions biden is taking calls with leaders of the country which reflects the inevitability of his ascent to power meanwhile the president is staying behind closed doors tweeting in wild block capital letters and unleashing a purge of the pentagon s civilian leadership in what one current defense official called dictator moves and william cohen former secretary of defense and republican senator said the administration s conduct is more akin to a dictatorship than a democracy the presidentelect is reassuring the american people with a composure granted by an election win that massive voter fraud have little chance of overturning the will of the voters the presidentelect on tuesday consciously avoided escalating a confrontation with trump who is withholding the access and funding that incoming presidents normally rely on to stand up their administrations but while trump will remain president until january an unmistakable symbolic transfer of authority is taking place despite trump s efforts to deny his successor legitimacy we do nt see anything that s slowing us down quite frankly biden said threshold of electoral votes according to projections from cnn and other major news outlets and has a chance of matching trump s total of electoral votes given his leads in georgia and arizona the department of homeland security meanwhile pushed back on rumors that ballots were cast on behalf of dead people but the trump team only dug itself deeper into a bizarre parallel universe one where the president has already secured a second term consistent with the embrace of misinformation and alternative facts that there will be a smooth transition to a second trump administration pompeo said asked whether trump s refusal to concede undercut traditional us critiques of corrupt elections abroad pompeo rounded on a reporter that s ridiculous and you know it s ridiculous and you asked it because it s ridiculous as recently as monday pompeo issued a statement warning of electoral issues in myanmar which was long ruled by the military and has endured a difficult transition to semidemocracy where a lodestar in wilmington delaware the presidentelect pointedly refused to pour fuel on the fire dismissing the idea that he needed to take legal action to release transition funds and making clear that he was confident that the process of assuming power would eventually work itself out he described trump s behavior since election day as an embarrassment and after saying he was seeking to be tactful added it will not help the president s legacy asked whether republicans would ever accept they will they will and he suggested with a halfsmile that gop senators were mildly intimidated by the president biden who once had a reputation as a windy public speaker is showing a new persona to the american people he noticeably chose his words carefully on tuesday putting on a show of calm as he experiences the transformation that often comes over victorious candidates as they begin to assume the weight of the presidency after winning elections trump by contrast is refusing to concede and leaving the country more vulnerable with revenge firings that threaten to weaken critical national security agencies sources told barbara starr and cnn s pentagon team that the dismissals might be motivated by pushback from esper and his team against a withdrawal from afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met and other pending security issues this is scary it s very unsettling one defense official told cnn these are dictator moves republican senator too called out the trump administration s refusal to acknowledge biden s win tuesday night saying the way they are conducting themselves is more akin to a dictatorship than a democracy i think that the state department has been politicized just like the dod has tried to be politicized and what we ve done to undermine the intelligence community and other agencies i think is consistent with what has been taking place for four years now he told cnn s trump is going to be uniquely distracted from world events and national security murphy said former national security adviser john bolton told cnn s wolf blitzer that pompeo s comments on a trump transition were delusional i think he has eviscerated his credibility internationally because i think there are very few people even in the us government who believe that is the case bolton said despite trump s claims that his second term is being stolen from him the president s headway in its efforts to claim massive fraud the gambit looks increasingly like a political exercise as trump struggles to come to terms with his defeat while republican senators scared of the president s political base refuse to cross him especially with two georgia runoff elections scheduled for january that will decide control of their chamber trump s already minuscule opportunity to change the course of the election is diminishing by the day biden is now more than votes ahead in pennsylvania is up by in ballots in arizona it is not clear whether there are sufficient remaining votes left in the grand canyon state for the president to overtake the presidentelect as the trump campaign filed a new longshot lawsuit in michigan which biden won by nearly than votes its communications director tim murtaugh said we do believe that ultimately president trump will be declared the winner of this election but benjamin ginsberg a veteran republican election lawyer said that the trump campaign was a long to overturn the outcome of the election to win cases they have to put enough results into play to change the outcome of the election in individual states and in none of the suits they have filed around the country are they anywhere close to doing that in any state ginsberg said on cnn s the situation room still senate majority leader mitch mcconnell dug in tuesday on his insistence that trump was within his rights to pursue his complaints i think and not act like this is extraordinary the newly reelected kentucky republican said we are going to get through this period and we will swear in the winner on january the th just like we have every four years since while many observers believe mcconnell is playing a long political game with the georgia runoffs and the midterm congressional elections in mind the silence of republican senators is emboldening trump s intransigence the world has already moved on but break with the president many world leaders are moving to embrace biden including a number of whom who saw themselves as ideological counterparts of the president biden s campaign released statements on the presidentelect s calls with the leaders of france germany and ireland biden also spoke to british prime minister boris johnson whose populist leanings made him a good fit with trump johnson promised to work with biden in a postcovid era even turkish president recep tayyip erdogan who bonded with trump over public message congratulating biden on his election success and saudi king salman and crown prince mohammed bin salman who has a close and controversial relationship with trump and his soninlaw jared kushner sent biden a cable in which they conveyed congratulations on his excellency s victory in the presidential elections biden said he had a simple message for all the world leaders i am letting them know

       "334209  cnn president donald trump s administration is taking on the characteristics of a tottering regime with its loyalty tests destabilizing attacks on the military chain of command a deepening bunker mentality and increasingly delusional claims of political victory in response a visibly confident presidentelect joe biden is going out of his way to project calm amid the deepening chaos even as trump and senior republicans still refuse to acknowledge the president s defeat in a stunning break with america s democratic traditions biden is taking calls with leaders of the country which reflects the inevitability of his ascent to power meanwhile the president is staying behind closed doors tweeting in wild block capital letters and unleashing a purge of the pentagon s civilian leadership in what one current defense official called dictator moves and william cohen former secretary of defense and republican senator said the administration s conduct is more akin to a dictatorship than a democracy the presidentelect is reassuring the american people with a composure granted by an election win that massive voter fraud have little chance of overturning the will of the voters the presidentelect on tuesday consciously avoided escalating a confrontation with trump who is withholding the access and funding that incoming presidents normally rely on to stand up their administrations but while trump will remain president until january an unmistakable symbolic transfer of authority is taking place despite trump s efforts to deny his successor legitimacy we do nt see anything that s slowing us down quite frankly biden said threshold of electoral votes according to projections from cnn and other major news outlets and has a chance of matching trump s total of electoral votes given his leads in georgia and arizona the department of homeland security meanwhile pushed back on rumors that ballots were cast on behalf of dead people but the trump team only dug itself deeper into a bizarre parallel universe one where the president has already secured a second term consistent with the embrace of misinformation and alternative facts that there will be a smooth transition to a second trump administration pompeo said asked whether trump s refusal to concede undercut traditional us critiques of corrupt elections abroad pompeo rounded on a reporter that s ridiculous and you know it s ridiculous and you asked it because it s ridiculous as recently as monday pompeo issued a statement warning of electoral issues in myanmar which was long ruled by the military and has endured a difficult transition to semidemocracy where a lodestar in wilmington delaware the presidentelect pointedly refused to pour fuel on the fire dismissing the idea that he needed to take legal action to release transition funds and making clear that he was confident that the process of assuming power would eventually work itself out he described trump s behavior since election day as an embarrassment and after saying he was seeking to be tactful added it will not help the president s legacy asked whether republicans would ever accept they will they will and he suggested with a halfsmile that gop senators were mildly intimidated by the president biden who once had a reputation as a windy public speaker is showing a new persona to the american people he noticeably chose his words carefully on tuesday putting on a show of calm as he experiences the transformation that often comes over victorious candidates as they begin to assume the weight of the presidency after winning elections trump by contrast is refusing to concede and leaving the country more vulnerable with revenge firings that threaten to weaken critical national security agencies sources told barbara starr and cnn s pentagon team that the dismissals might be motivated by pushback from esper and his team against a withdrawal from afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met and other pending security issues this is scary it s very unsettling one defense official told cnn these are dictator moves republican senator too called out the trump administration s refusal to acknowledge biden s win tuesday night saying the way they are conducting themselves is more akin to a dictatorship than a democracy i think that the state department has been politicized just like the dod has tried to be politicized and what we ve done to undermine the intelligence community and other agencies i think is consistent with what has been taking place for four years now he told cnn s trump is going to be uniquely distracted from world events and national security murphy said former national security adviser john bolton told cnn s wolf blitzer that pompeo s comments on a trump transition were delusional i think he has eviscerated his credibility internationally because i think there are very few people even in the us government who believe that is the case bolton said despite trump s claims that his second term is being stolen from him the president s headway in its efforts to claim massive fraud the gambit looks increasingly like a political exercise as trump struggles to come to terms with his defeat while republican senators scared of the president s political base refuse to cross him especially with two georgia runoff elections scheduled for january that will decide control of their chamber trump s already minuscule opportunity to change the course of the election is diminishing by the day biden is now more than votes ahead in pennsylvania is up by in ballots in arizona it is not clear whether there are sufficient remaining votes left in the grand canyon state for the president to overtake the presidentelect as the trump campaign filed a new longshot lawsuit in michigan which biden won by nearly than votes its communications director tim murtaugh said we do believe that ultimately president trump will be declared the winner of this election but benjamin ginsberg a veteran republican election lawyer said that the trump campaign was a long to overturn the outcome of the election to win cases they have to put enough results into play to change the outcome of the election in individual states and in none of the suits they have filed around the country are they anywhere close to doing that in any state ginsberg said on cnn s the situation room still senate majority leader mitch mcconnell dug in tuesday on his insistence that trump was within his rights to pursue his complaints i think and not act like this is extraordinary the newly reelected kentucky republican said we are going to get through this period and we will swear in the winner on january the th just like we have every four years since while many observers believe mcconnell is playing a long political game with the georgia runoffs and the midterm congressional elections in mind the silence of republican senators is emboldening trump s intransigence the world has already moved on but break with the president many world leaders are moving to embrace biden including a number of whom who saw themselves as ideological counterparts of the president biden s campaign released statements on the presidentelect s calls with the leaders of france germany and ireland biden also spoke to british prime minister boris johnson whose populist leanings made him a good fit with trump johnson promised to work with biden in a postcovid era even turkish president recep tayyip erdogan who bonded with trump over public message congratulating biden on his election success and saudi king salman and crown prince mohammed bin salman who has a close and controversial relationship with trump and his soninlaw jared kushner sent biden a cable in which they conveyed congratulations on his excellency s victory in the presidential elections biden said he had a simple message for all the world leaders i am letting them know

       "2    the way the end of days should be a story from diane cook s collection man v nature takes place in a flooded world the story s unnamed narrator defends their home from desperate strangers with the help of a man named gary the narrator s neighbor meanwhile houses every newcomer who washes up on his porchhe welcomes so many people in fact that his house begins to deteriorate no matter how bad things get for the neighbor and the refugees living in his house isolationist ways eventually gary abandons the narrator to help the neighbor and the narrator reacts by suspecting gary and the neighbor of conspiring against him we leave the narrator lingering near their front door a knife in each hand waiting to defend his home from a siege that may never come this story is a piece of climate change fiction or clifi sure but it s also a parable a morality tale about the decisions one must make apocalypse do you empathize with the survivalist narrator or his selfless neighbor how would you act if your neighborhood flooded tomorrow diane cook centers her stories around moral conundrums like this one as man v nature s title suggests cook forces readers to question the limits of their humanity in the face of extreme circumstancessupernatural environmental futuristic or a combination of the three cook s debut novel the new wilderness towers above the stories in her collection it takes people are struggling to survive in urban society referred to simply as the city a group of the most vulnerable citizens retreat to an area known as the wilderness to live in a nomadic huntergatherer place called the community our protagonist bea decides to join the community because her daughter agnes is sick if she and agnes don t leave the city for the wilderness agnes s death is all but assured the emotional core of the the relationship between bea and agnes the most intricate and morally arresting relationship cook has conjured to date bea has joined the community to save her daughter s life and yet bea has entered into an existence full of cultish polyamory grisly hunting expeditions the consumption of raw meat insects and rodents not to mention maiming and death when bea can t bear life in the community any longer and abandons agnes to return to the city cook switches from bea and in doing so forces us to challenge our conception of bea from the viewpoint of the daughter she abandoned agnes dismisses her mean mother who had run away the meanest of them all perhaps she d never been anything but a mean mother and every kiss had been cruel meant to eventually because pain with its absence in presenting both sides of the situation cook asks how can we morally balance the initial sacrifice with the later abandonment how much are action considering the brutality of life in the wilderness to which bea was exposed things only get more complicated after bea returns to the community and attempts to get back into her daughter s good graces agnes hated that her mind would not let her curl back into her mother would not let her run to her without a care or worry or resentment would not let her forget that cloud of dust her mother had disappeared into she fell asleep to the exhalation of and to the urgency of her own thrumming heart the relationship between mother and daughter continues to oscillate between caring and rejection love and hate as agnes matures and becomes a woman in her own right falls in love and begins to contemplate becoming a mother herself a process that throws her understanding of her mother s actions into a new light entirely the community s social dynamics place a similar strain on our beliefs carl the community s selfserving philosopherking encounters a gaggle of newcomers who insist upon resolving issues by vote just like that the community evolves from a monarchy into a democracy a change that causes more problems than it solves as the majority begin to become tyrannical if you strip away its apocalyptic backdrop the novel presents fresh commentary about groupthink human psychology and governance by the end of it the situation makes you wonder if democracy will be the most effective way to survive the apocalypse otherworldly terrains at the outset of the novel when the community as a group are crossing a river they witness a loose log stripped naked of its bark and limbs bobb ing and roll ing past even though the nearby landscape was treeless later on agnes s friend celeste peel s back the moss in one wet green sheet and reveal s a notch in the rock from the notch a neonpink and when the community subsequently travel to the top of a caldera a round a bend the lakes emerged one black and one blue the closer they got the more the black one evolved into a deep murky green and the blue one became white like the clouded sky above it diane cook makes the wilderness feel as real and surreal as if you were living in it yourself in concert with the sharp rendering of social relations cook makes novels like hers can help us more deeply understand the estrangement and horror produced by each extreme weather pattern or mass extinction event we read about in the news in his book the great derangement climate change and the unthinkable amitav ghosh decries the ghettoization of climate change as a subject within the landscape of fiction it could even be said that fiction

consigned to the category of clifi merely because of their subject matter and aren t ever compared to ballard s high rise boyle s the tortilla curtain or mcewan s atonement but this is changing now critics consider weather jenny offill s fragmented rumination on climate best works of englishlanguage fiction published this year john lanchester s climate change parable the wall was heralded as a timely work last year and diane cook has found herself on this year s booker prize short list what has precipitated clifi s acceptance by the mainstream literary establishment open a newspaper turn on the tv climate change is no longer a phenomenon for science fiction writers alone to envision we are living in a climatechanged world the city in diane cook or lahore or miami climate change fiction

alive in the next years the next years will those sacrifices even\n",

sunday increased pressure on russia over the poisoning of russian opposition politician alexei navalny warning that a lack of support by moscow in the investigation could force germany to rethink the fate of a germanrussian gas pipeline project i hope the russians won t force us to change our position regarding the nord stream pipeline being built under the baltic sea german foreign minister heiko maas told weekly bild am sonntag maas also said that if there won t be an investigation in the coming days we will have to consult with our partners he did not exclude possible punishments against russia telling the newspaper that if we think about sanctions they should be pinpointed effectively however maas also admitted that halting the building of the nearly completed gas pipeline would harm german and european companies whoever demands this has to be aware of the consequences he said more than companies from european countries are involved in the from germany the german government has come under growing pressure to use the joint germanrussian pipeline project as leverage in getting russia to provide answers on navalny the nord stream project would deliver russian gas directly to germany under the baltic sea when completed bypassing ukraine navalny a kremlin critic and corruption investigator fell ill on a flight to moscow last month and was taken to a hospital in the siberian city of omsk he has been in an induced coma in a berlin hospital treatment on august german authorities have said that tests showed that he had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the novichok group british authorities previously identified the nerve agent developed during the soviet era as the poison used on former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter in england in we have high expectations from the russians to bring light into this severe crime maas said if they have nothing to do with this attack then it s facts on the table president vladimir putin s spokesman has brushed off allegations that the kremlin was involved in poisoning navalny and said last week that germany hadn t provided moscow with any evidence about the politician s condition german chancellor angela merkel called navalny s poisoning an attempted murder that aimed to silence one of putin s fiercest critics and called for a full investigation merkel personally offered the country s assistance in treating navalny he s now in stable condition but doctors expect a long recovery and haven t ruled out that the yearold could face longterm effects to his health merkel has previously rejected the idea that the navalny case should be linked to the nord stream gas pipeline the yous has long opposed the project which has been increasingly a source of friction between berlin and washington in early august three republican senators threatened sanctions against an operator of a baltic sea port located in merkel s parliamentary constituency over its part in is a key staging post for ships involved in its construction the yous argues the project will endanger european security by making germany overly dependent on russian gas it s also opposed by ukraine and poland which will be bypassed by the pipeline under the baltic as well as some other european nations in addition to the security concerns the yous also wants to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas or lng to europe\n",
